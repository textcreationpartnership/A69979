            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>OF all ſorts of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Publick, in this keen and ſatyrical Age, I know none that have prov'd ſo beneficial to Souls as thoſe which have treated <hi>ſolely</hi> and <hi>practically</hi> about ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Moral or Divine Subject. And indeed a conſiderate Man need not wonder how this comes to paſs; for as ſuch Subjects are the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, becauſe they ſerve the Intereſt of our moſt <hi>permanent</hi>

A few general and quaint Sentences will not ſerve the Turns of mean Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities: The moſt are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>wiſe</hi> enough nor willing enough to be <hi>ſo,</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd and awaken'd by <hi>By-Hints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Anatomiſts, in their Purſuits after a more perfect Knowledge of the admirable Structure of Human Bodies, pry into even the minuteſt Parts. They are fit Patterns for Authors to imitate, for there is no Method ſo likely to enrich Men's Minds with a competent ſtore of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb facs="tcp:51886:3"/>Wiſdom for the Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Manners, and the making them eminent Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to Mankind, and to have a clear Survey of the whole Body of Truth, as diving into its very Bowels, and diſſecting all the Veins and Membrules of it. The ſeparate Obſervation of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the Branches of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they are laid by the Hands of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> in the Bible of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Revelation</hi> preſents us with a pleaſant Sight of the <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> Tendency and Uſe of <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> one of them; and the rare Contexture &amp; beautiful Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of them all <hi>together.</hi> Do Phyſicians by their Art

Why? ſo many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians too by narrowly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Nature of ev'ry Duty <hi>ſingly</hi> and <hi>apart,</hi> ſee the Office and Serviceableneſs of it to Man's Spirit, and that the leaſt of them cann't be ſpar'd by one who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his Primitive Frame.

            <pb facs="tcp:51886:4"/>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince Friendly Reproof
<pb facs="tcp:51886:5"/>is ſo momentous an Office of Friendſhip that no one can entirely diſcharge his Duty in that <hi>Relation</hi> without Reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 'Tis very convenient that every Chriſtian ſhould be inform'd of his indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Obligation to reprove his Friend, and be ſtock'd with Rules for the more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Adminiſtration of it. So that I can foreſee no juſt occaſion of making a long Apology for writing a parti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cular Diſcourſe concerning it. And as the Dignity and Uſefulneſs of Friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof will vindicate me from the Imputation of being la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh of my Time and Ink in handling it thus by it ſelf;
<pb facs="tcp:51886:5"/>ſo there are many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which will juſtifie the Publication of it, with an enumeration of which I ſhall not ſtand to trouble you. But there's one which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear mentioning.</p>
            <p>We live in an Age in which Curioſity it ſelf is almoſt ſurfeited with both ingenious and elaborate Tracts on al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Subjects, and yet <hi>Friendly Reproof, Admonition, Gratulation,</hi> and the other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of <hi>fraternal Sociableneſs</hi> have been little more than juſt skirmiſh'd upon and coldly recommended. Whence this ſtrange Overſight took its Riſe it is not material now to enquire. To confine my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb facs="tcp:51886:6"/>to the Cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. That a Work of this Nature is too much wanted, is very manifeſt by the ſo common Omiſſion of this kind of Charity; for not only thoſe Wretches who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlav'd to the worſt Habits and intolerable Enormities, but even Men who are ſtrict Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and exemplary for other Acts of Beneficence, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtupidly guilty of it. In the <hi>first</hi> ſort, who wallow in very filthy Vices, this Neglect may be ſuſpected to be <hi>preſumptuous</hi> Wickedneſs; but the conſtant Circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the latter obliges me in Chriſtian Charity to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to the want of due
<pb facs="tcp:51886:6"/>Conviction in them. Indeed I have obſerv'd this in a great many pious Chriſtians, who had never a diſtinct Notion of Friendly Reproof, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed they were more at a loſs to underſtand this Moral Duty than any other. 'Twas this Thought which made me commiſerate the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Countrymen, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of the ſincerer Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our excellent Church. Some have been ſo courteous as to own that they have gain'd more Light by my Conferences with them about this Matter than they ever receiv'd before, and deſir'd me, for the ſake of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, to pleaſure 'em with
<pb facs="tcp:51886:7"/>the Publication of a diſtinct Treatiſe on this Subject; which Propoſal, to ſpeak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly, I was very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to comply with: For I think it very fitting at ſuch a Time as this, when <hi>Lay Chriſtians</hi> are ſo very apt to inveigh againſt the Lazineſs and Unſucceſsfulneſs of the Clergy, to acquaint 'em what they ought to do for one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's Souls, among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that they may turn their Boldneſs againſt their excellent Paſtors into a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity upon their own Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; for, unleſs I am mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, Miniſters are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being omnipreſent as others; and if the Laity
<pb facs="tcp:51886:7"/>will not add their Endeavours to thoſe of their Miniſters, God will not condemn theſe for not converting voluntary Creatures irreſiſtibly, which ſeems to be more than his own Province.</p>
            <p>Some learned Friends, who had greater Abilities than my ſelf, could not be wrought upon to ſet about this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Work. When Hopes and Requeſts were defeated, I could not think it becoming one (who had weigh'd the Uſefulneſs of this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and for that Reaſon had been ſuch an importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Suiter to others for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Treatiſe about this Subject) to affect Deafneſs to
<pb facs="tcp:51886:8"/>the Requeſts of well-meaning People; not that I think the Requeſts of Friends are a ſufficient Excuſe for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of a Book, if the Subject be frivolous, or (tho' weighty and uſeful) has been largly &amp; didactically handl'd before, for this breeds Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: But I think that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid in this Caſe. Men have been very ſtingy of their Advice about this Duty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we can imagine that ſome few Hints in general Treatiſes of Friendſhip, or a caſual Sermon or two upon it, are ſufficient upon a Subject, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to explain the Nature of which, common Prejudices conſidered, will take up near
<pb facs="tcp:51886:8"/>the Compaſs of two Sermons. 'Twas this Conſideration, with my peculiar Love to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that forc'd me to review ſome of my own Papers about it, and tranſcribe 'em fair for the Preſs, hoping, that ſince better Supplies could not be obtain'd, theſe Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be accepted kindly, ſince they may contribute ſomething to the convincing Chriſtians of the Importance of this Duty, and animating them to the prudent Exerciſe of it. It can be no Breach of Modeſty to ſuppoſe that it will be better than no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diſcourſe about it at all; and perhaps the Simplicity of both the Style and Thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:51886:9"/>may make it fitter for the Uſe of Illiterate People than cloſe and polite Writings.</p>
            <p>And now, Reader, my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is (ſince I have done my poor Endeavour to bring Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof into Faſhion again, in which Enterprize, if I ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, I ſhall do a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Piece of Service to my Country and the Cauſe of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue) that you would deign to joyn your Intereſt with mine at the Throne of Grace, in a fervent Prayer, that this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Treatiſe may be honour'd with the greateſt Encomium, th'Improvement of our Minds in the <hi>Theory,</hi> and of our <hi>Converſation</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip</hi> by the conſtant and diſcreet
<pb facs="tcp:51886:9"/>Execution of what we are herein exhorted to.</p>
            <p>With which glorious effect that theſe Lines may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, I chearfully reſign their Fortune to the Bleſſing and wiſe Diſpoſal of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Providence of the One inviſible and immortal God (to whoſe Glory my Heart has dedicated them from the Womb) in the Name of <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi>

                  <p>THE Method, in which I promis'd to range my Thoughts, obliges me, in the firſt Place, to give a plain and diſtinct Account of the Nature of <hi>Friendly Rep oof.</hi> This will, I doubt, take up more Room th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n I ſuſpected, when I firſt reſolv'd upon this Undertaking; but, however, 'tis ſo very needful, that it cann't be excuſably paſt by: For it is impoſſible for any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to repreſent his Sentiments, about any Subject, in a due Light, unleſs the Nature of his Subject be firſt rightly underſtood. So that, tho' we ſhould lay down the ſtraiteſt Rules that can be given concerning
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51886:14"/>applying Reproof, they would be of no more Uſe to my Reader, before a juſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> has been founded in his Mind, than a Lecture about the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Motions of Light upon our Eyes, whence it is that we ſee ſo many Differences in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, would be to one born blind, who was always wholly devoid of the Idea of Colour in general. And truly the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have ſuch a perplext Idea of the Subject of this Book, that, out of Pity to thoſe mean Capacities, for whoſe benefit this Treatiſe was penn'd, I ſhall be forc'd to make uſe of that Length, in order to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle their Minds, which I do not at all delight in. And, moreover, which makes this Enquiry the more neceſſary, it may eaſily be obſerv'd, That the Irregular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions which moſt Men always have had, and ſtill do entertain, about <hi>Friendly Reproof,</hi> have prov'd very Injurious not only to the <hi>Fortune,</hi> but alſo to the <hi>Reputation</hi> of the Exerciſe of this Duty, as will ſhortly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Since therefore this Enquiry is ſo neceſſary, we will immediately ſet about it.</p>

                  <p>CArnal Prejudice and Inadvertence are the two principal Sources of Error; and doubtleſs either one or both of them have a great Hand in making the <hi>bare telling a Perſon of a real Fault, before his Face,</hi> paſs ſo current with the multitude for a perfect Definition of <hi>Reproof,</hi> as for the moſt part it does.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:51886:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>That this lame Definition is one main Reaſon why <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> is ſo very Nice and Difficult a Subject, and is very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, ſetting aſide the great Miſchief it has been the Author of, will, I hope, quickly appear to any but ſuch whoſe great Affection for a Diſcharge from Duty, dreſſing up Sin in the Garb of Virtue, and for being honour'd at the ſame Time with the Title of Good and well-beſigning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, has brib'd them to ſhut their Eyes againſt Conviction.</p>
                  <p>For, to weigh it's Conſequences: Firſt, if this Account of Reproof is perfect, then Admonition and Reproof are one and the ſame thing; For if one Man admoniſhes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>againſt,</hi> and the ſecond reproves him <hi>for</hi> the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> Fault, after the firſt had admoniſh'd him againſt it, 'tis evident both theſe Perſons told that third Perſon of a Fault to his Face: And 'tis as evident that he who admoniſh'd him, and he who reprov'd him, did two diſtinct Acts of Beneficence: But theſe two Acts are confounded by the foremention'd Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Reproof.</hi> But, for Explanation's ſake, we will dwell a little here, and be beholden to the Light of a few Inſtances for a thorough Diſcovery of the Difference between <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Reproof.</hi> This I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51886:15"/>think is the more convenient to be done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they very often go together, are near-a-kin, and very like, and therefore often miſtaken one for the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Reproof</hi> are both of them extraordinary Acts of Charity to the Soul; they both aim at the Promotion of Virtue, and the Prevention of Sin. Speech and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are the ſole Inſtruments of ſerving Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue either of theſe ways. So far they both agree, their End and Conveyances are the ſame; but, nevertheleſs, there are other Circumſtances, which make them very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably different.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, Admonition puts us in Mind of approaching Dangers, and is tender'd pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inſtil Caution and Circumſpection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Friend; it has an Eye to the <hi>future:</hi> But Reproof acquaints of <hi>paſt</hi> and actual Faults, and ſtrives to beget in the Offender humble Acknowledgment of, and hearty and compleat Penitence for them. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, If I am aware that my Friend's Buſineſs happens to compel him, as he has regard, tho' but in a moderate degree, to his own or Family's Temporal Convenience, to meet ſome Company at ſome certain Times, who are inſlav'd to a fondneſs for Intemperance, and ſo inur'd to the Scourges of Debauchery that Crapula's are no more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51886:16"/>than Flea-bites, or perchance Pleaſures to them; and who deſign, when they have got my Friend among them, to be forcing Cups and multiplying Healths, not out of Loyalty and Love but a malitious Principle to carry on the Devil's Plot, and to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over infirm Conſtitutions, to whom exceſs of Liquor is not ſo portable; I will for the ſake of his Welfare indulge my Jealouſie of the State of his Soul, and admoniſh him of it, that he may be arm'd againſt the worſt, prepare his Heart againſt the Temptation by Prayer, Deliberation, Conſultation, Reſolution, and other holy Aids and Policies. Thus, by Help of a loving Whiſper, and a ſeaſonable <hi>Memento,</hi> he may be made both humble enough not to run too haſtily into Dangers, and alſo chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, prudent and couragious enough, with a pious Truſt in God, who by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has call'd him to the Conflict (even tho' he ſhould be one naturally of a frail and limber Diſpoſition) to reſiſt and baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ity, Reproaches and a crafty Aſſault, which 'tis hardeſt of all to withſtand; I mean their ſeeming Civility and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Concern for his being fall'n into Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, which deprives him of all that Mirth and Pleaſure which they enjoy, if we may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51886:16"/>truſt the Surface, the loudneſs of their Laughter, the Purſineſs of their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe without peeping within upon thoſe growing Diſorders of the Blood, which are very buſie in preparing Aches and Pains for their laſt Years, and a more ſumptuous Feaſt ſuddenly for Worms.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, my dear Friend, by this means may avoid their Vice without ſhunning their Perſons, be courteous without being caught by their Flatteries, ſociable without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of their Sin, virtuous not moroſe, may ſave his ſecular Advantage without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing which tends to the Loſs of his Soul.</p>
                  <p>But, if for all this, or indeed tho' I had not admoniſh'd him, I find him vanquiſh'd by Drink when he leaves his Company, I think it my part to arreſt the firſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, when his Faculties are recover'd, to reprove him for not parting with Men, 'till he had made himſelf like a Beaſt. This is matter of Fact, and therefore Matter of <hi>Reproof,</hi> not a mere poſſibility of Sinning, as in the Caſe of <hi>Admonition.</hi> A <hi>Foreſight of Tempration</hi> makes <hi>Admonition</hi> ſeaſonable, but only <hi>Complyance with Temptation</hi> makes <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>roof</hi> ſeaſonable.</p>
                  <p>But, ſecondly, Admonition and Reproof differ in as much as Admonition may addreſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51886:17"/>to all the Faculties of the Soul, whereas Reproof can only meddle with the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the Will. Thus, for inſtance, if I foreſee any Danger of my Friend's being enſnar'd into the Commiſſion of any certain Sin, tho' he was never guilty of it to my Knowledge yet I judge it my Duty, as I am his well-wiſher, to admoniſh him againſt it; if he has ever done it before, that he do it no more, and if he has not done it, to make him ſtill the more carefully cheriſh and retain his Innocence. Perhaps he is not ſenſible that ſuch an Action is a Fault; if ſo, my Admonition informs him that it is ſuch by producing ſome poſitive Divine Law, or evidencing it by ſome clear Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from ſome poſitive Divine Law, or from ſome common Principle or other, which all, or at leaſt moſt and the ſobereſt, Men grant to be a firm Baſis of Arguing. When I thus <hi>admomiſh</hi> him, I do an Act of Charity to his Underſtanding: I implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtruct him in ſuch an Admonition; I say implicitly, for I muſt acquaint you that <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> tho' they may be coincident, as in the pre ent Caſe, are two different Acts, and as diſtinct from one another as Admonition and Reproof: For tho, when I admoniſh a Friend againſt a Fault, which he did not know was a Fault,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51886:17"/>I inſtruct as well as admoniſh him, yet ſince when I began to ſpeak of this Fault, I conſidered him rather as one whoſe Soul was approaching to the Brink of Danger (being certain of this, that he was likely to be tempted) than as a Perſon who was ignorant that his Complyance with the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation, foreſeen by me, is ſinful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious (for I was uncertain whether or no he knew that it is ſinful) 'tis evident that this Exertion of Beneficence was <hi>caſually,</hi> and therefore but <hi>materially Inſtruction,</hi> whereas 'twas <hi>deſignedly,</hi> and therefore <hi>formally Admonition.</hi> For tho' he had not been ignorant that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Compliance with the approaching Temptation is ſinful, yet my warning him of it at this Juncture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Temptation accoſts him, might have been useful by reaſon of other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances (and if it may be uſeful where there is no need of Inſtruction, then they are two diſtinct Acts) for tho' this my Friend has been told, and is convinced, that the Sin, which I apprehend him in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood a going to be ſtrongly ſollicited to, is a Sin, yet perhaps at that time he may be inconſiderate, his Imagination may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Impoſtures, and may fancy ſome mighty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Purchaſe in ſhewing his Obedience to the ſaid Sollicitation: His Memory and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51886:18"/>Recollective Faculty may be drowſie, nay perhaps in a dead Sleep. On all or any of theſe accounts my Admonition may be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, as a charitable deed to his Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by painting to the Life the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Sin which lies in wait for him, and the pitifulness of the Benefit which the commiſſion of it can, at the beſt, bring him in, if that benefit be compar'd in the Ballance with the Favour of God and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which will be interrupted by his ſo doing: Now, 'tis advantageous to my Friend, in that Condition, with reſpect to his Underſtanding and Memory; at ſuch a Seaſon 'tis a good Office to both of them together; for by awakening the latter it puts the former into a due Poſture of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which is the faithfulleſt Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Again, there may be a Time when my Friend may know ſuch or ſuch an Action to be a Sin, but nevertheleſs may not be aware of his being in inſtant Danger of being beleaguer'd by it, unleſs a Stander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by mind him of it, and conſequently how well ſoever his Soul may be habitually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd againſt all Temptation, he cannot make ſuch actual Preparation againſt that particular Temptation, unleſs he is admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd of it; for 'tis particular Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51886:18"/>that makes him capable of making ſuch an actual Preparation as is neceſſary to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine thoſe crafty Devices, and powerful Politicks which the Devil and his Agents, both within and without him, may uſe to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and betray him into the Sin.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, ſuppoſe the Memory ſhould be brisk, and the Underſtanding be not benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Ignorance, nor canker'd through Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs of Thought; nay, tho' he ſhould have a Foreſight of the Danger, yet perhaps the Will may be too pliant and flexible to the Temptation, which I perceive juſt lighting upon his Head: Perhaps 'tis a Temptation to that Sin to which the Soul yields ſooneſt of all, a Sin to which his Nature, Education or Calling inclines him moſt. The Thoughts may be ſound when the Affections lean awry: An ill Bent may be cocker'd in the Heart, when ſound Notions flourish in the Head: He may want to be fortifi'd, tho' not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. How ſeaſonable <hi>Admonition</hi> is, when Matters ſtand thus, I need not add: All true Chriſtians who feel Divine Senſations in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves find Temptations very painful to 'em, and conſequently find it very difficult to row againſt the Tide of Temptation, when the Will is ſo treacherous. Thus you ſee how <hi>Admonition</hi> has to do with all the Faculties of the Soul; but <hi>Reproof</hi> does not reach so far.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51886:19"/>Reproof ſtrikes not at the Underſtanding, nor at all tampers with the Imagination: No wiſe Man will reprove his Friend for Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, unleſs 'tis wilful; and then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves him not for his Ignorance, but for his foolishly abuſing the Opportunities he had to improve his Mind by Knowledge, which would have prevented that Ignorance. 'Tis uncreaſonable to blame a Perſon for what could not be avoided. Ignorance conſider'd abſtractly from the Will is a Misfortune, not a Fault: A Pagan cann't be blam'd for not coming to the Lord's Table: 'Tis no Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Duty in him, becauſe he knew it not to be a Duty; but he may be juſtly reprov'd for being churliſh or ſlothful, ſince the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of ſuch Habits may be learnt in Nature's School, and for that Reaſon they are ſuch Habits as lie open to the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mind, unaſſiſted by external Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Faults only are the Subject of Reproof; now a Fault is, in more Words, any thing done or omitted with the conſent of the Will, in oppoſition to that degree of Knowledge, which the Mind is in preſent poſſeſſion of, concerning good and evil. Knowledge is preſuppos'd before the Will is capable of offending: Now Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the Subject of the <hi>Intellect,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where it is wanting it muſt be infus'd by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51886:19"/>Inſtruction, for the Intellect is the Object of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The Intellect is the ſole part of Man which is capable of being aſſiſted by that Help; whereas Admonition aſſiſts all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Soul, ſometimes ſeverally, and ſometimes two or more of them together: All the Faculties of the Soul are the poſſible Objects of it, as I think hath been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhewn: Whereas <hi>Reproof</hi> deals only with the Will and the Memory: The Will is the principal Object of its Relief, for it excites the Memory only, that the Will may be ſet to Rights. When one Man reproves another, he does not ſtand to tell him, That ſuch an Action is a Fault (for he ſuppoſes that the <hi>Reproved</hi> knows that already, for otherwiſe it would be his Buſineſs to inſtruct, not to chide) but he puts him in Mind that he committed that Fault, leſt he ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, and ſo not humble his Soul and repent of it, that he may dread it the more for the future.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, Souls in the State of Danger are the Objects of <hi>Admonition;</hi> but Souls in a ſtate of Actual, new-contracted Guilt are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Reproof. Admonition</hi> promotes Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, <hi>Reproof</hi> advances Patience, that Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition againſt the Sin, after 'tis repented of, may take the deeper Root in the Mind and Memory.</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51886:20"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another Difference between <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi> and <hi>Reproof</hi> is this; the Subjects of <hi>Admonition</hi> are more than the Subjects of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof: Admonition</hi> may ſafely meddle with Internal as well as External Acts and Habits: Whereas <hi>Reproof</hi> cann't ſafely touch upon any Faults, but thoſe which are viſible to the Senſes; which we prove thus.</p>
                  <p>God's general Prohibition of <hi>Pride, Malice, Envy;</hi> &amp;c. together with ev'ry individual human Creature's ſelf-conſciouſneſs of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to be tainted with theſe malignant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſitions of Spirit in ſuch and ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſufficiently aſcertains us that ev'ry Man is liable to be diſtemper'd with one or more of theſe Maladies, according to the Variety of Conditions to which he is obnoxious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Care is us'd to fill the Pores of the Soul with Thoughts which are of a ſufficiently Divine and Powerful Nature, to obſtruct the Inroad of the Infection. For ſince God does nothing in vain, 'tis clear that he would not have prohibited thoſe Habits, had he not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen a Neceſſity of ſuch a Prohibition; that is to ſay, that we ſhould all of us, ſome time or other be more or leſs tempted to all or ſome of them by bad Spirits: And as his both gracious and general Prohibition of them ſuggests that ev'ry Man lies open to theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the Hoſt of Hell, ſo does ev'ry Man's
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51886:20"/>self conſciouſneſs ſuggeſt the ſame thing too (which was the ſecond Proof hinted) ſince all Men are of the ſame Frame and Nature with ev'ry Man, as well internally as exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally (for God loves Uniformity in Works of the ſame kind) and therefore all do meet with ſuch Injections, more or leſs, whilſt they are here; tho' individual human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures different Use of their common Nature, and that common Grace which is tender'd to them all, to improve the common Faculties of the ſaid common Nature (which different Uſe of the ſaid common Opportunities qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies them for different Degrees of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Grace) may make ſome Souls abler, and others leſs able to reſiſt theſe Injections of the Devil and his Agents: For tho' God rewards an extraordinary Improvement of common Grace, with Additions of greater ſpiritual Strength, in proportion to the ſaid Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which makes ſuch improv'd Souls the more difficultly paſſable to the Injections of the Devil; as alſo, tho' the notorious Abuſe of common Grace lays the Souls of wicked Men more pervious to the Injections of bad Spirits, through the want of that Strength which decays by the diminution of particular Grace, of which God in juſt Judgment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them, yet all are vulnerable in this ſtate. When the Good ſhall enter into their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51886:21"/>ultimate State of Happineſs, and the Wicked into their ultimate State of Miſery; they may be both properly enough ſaid to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable: For the Saints will be perfectly invulnerable there, where they will be out of the Reach of all Temptation, where no Devil can any more come near to aſſault them than they can find it poſſible to wound God himſelf, in whoſe Preſence they continually dwell; and then the damn'd may be ſaid to be perfectly invulnerable, becauſe their Souls are all wound and anguiſh, and are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive of more horrible Impreſſions from the whole Camp of Darkneſs than thoſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are inſeparable to their ſtate of Eternal Damnation. Now, as the Bleſt and the Damn'd will have invulnerableneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them both in their laſt State, ſo 'tis common to them both while they are in this State, as have not undergone as long a Trial as Providence has deſign'd for them, to have vulnerable Souls, as well as vulnerable Bodies. Indeed their common vulnerableneſs here does admit of Degrees, whereas invulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs admits of none, and the Good cann't be ſaid to be as eaſily vulnerable as the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they are both vulnerable. Bad Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits muſt be at more Expence to wound a good Chriſtian than a bad one, yet the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is capable of being wounded. Now
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51886:21"/>'tis this Univerſal Senſe of the vulnerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Human Nature, taken in its full la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that is to ſay, Soul and Body, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſingly and ſometimes together, which is planted by Nature in ev'ry Man's Mind, that warrants a tender and affectionate Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, which Men, who have a judicious Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for their Friends, feel, at ſome Seaſons, glowing in their Breasts for one another's Souls. Conſequently, 'tis not only lawful but laudable to forewarn a Friend againſt thoſe Stains and Pollutions of the Heart, <hi>Pride, Envy, Malice, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimity, Diſtruſting Divine Providence, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Confidence in Self,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Admonition againſt Pride and Elation of Spirit is ſeaſonable when my Friend is on a ſudden rais'd to a higher Preferment than he did or could expect: And if he ſhould by ſome Private or Publick Revolution be brought to endure Hardſhip, to ſtruggle with a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Fortune or Contempt, 'twill be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to admoniſh him againſt giving Way to <hi>Dejection of Mind, Deſpondence, Diſcontent, Impatience, proſtituting his Conſcience,</hi> and the like: And whoever thinks himſelf above be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admoniſh againſt ſuch hurtful Habits, becauſe he is ſo happy as not to crouch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them at preſent, forgets his Make and State, forgets that he is of a brittle Frame,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51886:22"/>that he has a Soul that is as liable to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapidated by Devils, as his Body is by the Hoſtility of any of the Elements: He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets that he is in a State of floating Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, a State of Cumber and Combat, where the Saints triumphant were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly militant: In ſhort, he forgets that he is on this Side of Heaven, where many who once ſtood, have, for want of Vigilance, and probably, through the ſcornful Neglect of Admonition, in particular, deſperately fallen.</p>
                  <p>But ſince 'tis given to no Man to know his Friend's Heart any farther than he can gather from his own Information, and the common Tenor of his Carriage; and, moreover ſince no Man is fatally proud when he is Rich, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, Learned or in Dignity or great Eſteem; or neceſſitated to envy his Thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy, or hate his Competitor, or to blaspheme the Council of Heaven in Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, tho' all Men are too much in Danger of being dawb'd with ſuch odious Qualities, it follows, that ſuch internal Habits in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons are not capable of being reprov'd, unleſs the Owners of the Hearts infeſted with ſuch Leproſies make an ingenuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſuch Internal Diſorders, tho' they are in their own Nature worthy of <hi>Reproof:</hi> They are Subjects of General and unfixt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, but we cannot ſafely arraign This or

                  <p>Indeed, when we plainly ſee a Perſon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry himſelf too magiſterially, and making a Theatre of his Heart by arrogant boaſting; and a ſecond make ev'ry inoffenſive Word Fuel or Flame; or a third railing often againſt a particular Perſon behind his Back, this untoward Mien of theirs, licences us to ſuſpect that Envy, Self conceit, or a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome Temper lurks and ferments in their Hearts: And becauſe ſince we are Creatures capable of Suſpicion, and conſcious of the like Paſſions in our ſelves, when our animal Spirits undergo the like Agitations, we cann't help harbouring Suſpicions ariſing from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities: For probable Evidence is the cleareſt we can have of one another's Hearts: 'Tis prudent immediately to turn theſe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions into Charities, by admoniſhing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch Converſations againſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd ill Tempers of Mind: For it ſquares with our natural Notion of God's being a Good and Gracious Being, to believe that this Paſſion of Suſpicion was planted in our Nature, to fit us to heal one another's Sores, not to make us diſſociable and Devils to one another: But we ſhould never hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor

Marvel not, Reader, that I ſaid <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi> for tho' the Sentence may be <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi> true, yet it cannot be <hi>formally</hi> equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in. Man's Mouth, becauſe he has no right to judge his Fellow's Heart, our utmoſt Rule of judging it by, being but Probability; for all Men muſt grant that Conjectures and Gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are but fortuitous Judgments, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cann't be equitable, 'till Fortune and Providence can be prov'd the ſame Being. Whence we may diſcern, that tho' we may ſafely ſpeak againſt Pride and ſuch internal Habits, whatever they are, indeterminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Miniſters in the Pulpit, and Authors in Books, yet no Man can ſafely reprove an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for Pride or any internal ſinful Habit, becauſe Faults viſible to the Senſes are the ſole ſubject of Reproof in particular Perſons; but internal Habits don't lie open to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Senſe, which muſt, I think, be granted to make a very remarkable Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Reproof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Inſtance may make this clearer. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two Perſons, who profeſs to be my Friends, wrote two Books, one of them a trifling Pamphlet for the Socinians, or againſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51886:23"/>this Government, which God created and ſtill preſerves in ſo marvellous a manner (I ſaid <hi>created,</hi> for the late Revolution was ſo ſurprizing that the effecting of it can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be expreſſed by nothing but ſuch a Term, which denotes an inſtantaneous Act of the Divine Power) or, in ſhort, in Defence of any Opinion and Faction which aims at the Deſtruction of Peace in Church or State, I ſhould think it my Duty, as a Friend (I don't pretend to inform the Magiſtrate what is his) to rebuke him ſharply for contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much to the Intereſt of the black Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick below. This is a palpable Breach of Peace, and therefore gives juſt Occaſion of ſharp Rebuke. But ſuppoſe my other Friend compos'd his Book on an uſeful Subject, and fit to ſerve the Honour and Kingdom of Chriſt in their Hearts, who peruſe it with that Attention, Mixture of Devotion, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Condeſcenſion, which becomes wiſe and honeſt Readers, I ſhould think it very proper to forewarn this Friend againſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating himſelf in his own Thoughts for his Performance, or by reaſon of the Applauſe which it may be the Inſtrument of to him: And this I would do, as well knowing that the Devil is a very indefatigable ſubtle Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: If he cann't diſcourage Men by Sloth, and a contracted Spirit from endeavouring
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51886:24"/>to ſerve the Publick, he will, after their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Publick, be flinging in ſome Idea's and Fancies into the Minds of Publick Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; which, if they are hoſpitable to, will grow into that dangerous Habit <hi>Pride,</hi> which makes Men idle and ridiculous by their haughty Carriage, which will leſſen their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and ſo leſſen the Power of their Endeavours, by prejudicing People againſt their Perſons: But now, if inſtead of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing</hi> this Friend, I had arraign'd him of Vain-glory and Pride, as I did the other for his Hereſie or Faction, I ſhould have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted God, by uſurping that Tribunal which is proper only to Omniſcience, and ſo by my Pride miſt of doing that Good which my <hi>Admonition</hi> might very fairly expected to have done. In ſhort, an Author of a Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Book is an Object of <hi>Reproof,</hi> but an Author of a Good Book is an Object of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Admonition</hi> againſt Pride and Vainglory.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Reproof</hi> differ, becauſe <hi>Admonition</hi> is given without any degree of Diſpleaſure, but 'tis fitting to expreſs Diſpleaſure in proportion to the Fault, when we tender <hi>Reproof.</hi> The Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Admonition is bottom'd upon the peccability of Human Nature: That which prompts us is Jealouſie, a ſtill and ſilent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; conſequently, to be angry with a Friend,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51886:24"/>while we admoniſh him, is to be angry with him, becauſe he is peccable, which is very abſurd; as abſurd, we may be ſure, as to charge God fooliſhly, and to note down the Defects of his Handywork: He did not make Man perfect in that ſublime Senſe in which he himſelf is perfect. That Liberty and Principle of voluntary Agency with which Man was inveſted as ſoon as he was created, is God's Work, eſſential to him as a human Creature, and therefore peccability or poſſibility of Sinning is the Work of the Creator; for a faculty of Acting Voluntarily implies a Power of a different Choice, and therefore Man's being a voluntary Agent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that he may chuſe which he will have, Life or Death, Good or Evil, for they are both ſet before him; that is to ſay, he may ſin or obey, and if he is made ſo, that he may ſin, then he is peccable, for by a pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature we mean only a Creature that may ſin, not a Creature that muſt ſin.</p>
                  <p>But when we <hi>reprove</hi> a Friend, we are warm with Grief to ſee our ſecond Self chuſe Evil, when he might as well have choſe the Good: 'Tis monſtrous Folly to abuſe Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and imploy Liberty in the Ruin of our Souls. Poſſibility of Sinning can by no means be remov'd from our Natures, 'till 'tis throughly compleated and glorified; indeed when we ſhall commence Saints, peccability
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51886:25"/>will be as remote from our Beings, as poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of becoming Holy is from the Souls of the damn'd. Nevertheleſs, no one neceſſarily commits any particular actual Sin, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deny'd, unleſs we ſuppoſe Man rather a <hi>machinal</hi> than a <hi>voluntary</hi> Being. Now ſince no one fatally commits any viſible Sin, tho' we are all originally unclean from the Womb, and ſince Guilt is the Bane of our Being, one Friend's Fraternal Concern for another's Welfare, will not only urge him to uſe all loving Arts to defend his Friend againſt approaching Temptations, by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, but moreover compels him to be troubled in his behalf, whenever he ſees him worſted by them; and Guilt being a Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which ev'ry Man has a Hand, more or leſs, in pulling upon his own Head; this Grief will naturally ſwell into Anger, ſince the offending Friend might have avoided it, if he had us'd his Powers as he ought. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides too, <hi>Reproof</hi> has to do with the Will, a very refractory Faculty indeed; to be ſure more or leſs perverſe after any freſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which, for that Reaſon, cann't be handled to any purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo as to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd in order to it's being rectified again by any but ſuch a rough and rigid Paſſion as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is, which ſpeaks aloud, and awakens a Friend's Senſe of his Miſery, and want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Diſcipline and Watchfulneſs.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51886:25"/>Whence 'tis clear that Reſentment becomes <hi>Reproof,</hi> tho it ill comports with <hi>Admonition.</hi> This may ſuffice concerning the difference between <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Reproof.</hi> But tho' I have inſiſted on it ſome while, yet I think my ſelf oblig'd to give notice, that I neither pretend to have given, or did at all deſign to give, a full account of the diſtinct Nature of <hi>Admonition,</hi> which, God aſſiſting, ſhall be the Subject of a particular Treatiſe: But thus much I thought neceſſary to premiſe in this Place to diſtinguiſh Reproof from <hi>Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe I have obſerv'd that thoſe few Authors, who have been prevail'd upon to ſpeak a little, too little, I'm ſure, of <hi>Reproof,</hi> have confounded it with <hi>Admonition,</hi> which has made their Diſcourſes about it, to ſay no worſe, fruitleſs and inſignificant. But ſince <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Reproof</hi> differ in ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, 'tis manifeſt that the foremention'd Definition of <hi>Reproof</hi> is very imperfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it confounds two diſtinct Acts of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Beneficence, which is of a very pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, He that takes theſe two Acts for one and the ſame Duty, muſt take it alſo for granted, that when he has diſcharg'd one he has diſcharg'd both, ſo that he ll either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with Admoniſhing his Friend againſt complying with Temptations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever reproving him for actual Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51886:26"/>with them, or elſe he'll only reprove him for actual Tranſgreſſions of Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, without ever admoniſhing him againſt thoſe ill Propenſions and inveterate Diſorders of the inner Man, which are the ſole Sources of all the Irregularities of the Tongue, and all our other active and ſocial Faculties.</p>
                  <p>Nay, moreover, ſecondly, This curt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Reproof, by confounding <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> with <hi>it,</hi> not only affronts the Law, by leſſening our Duty, and impairs human Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by contracting our Charity, but it alſo fondles one of the moſt ſcurvy Humors which diſturb Converſation; for it gives a Patent to Cenſoriouſneſs, even that odious, turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, peſtilential Vice, Cenſoriouſneſs: For let Admonition and Reproof be once allow'd to be the ſame, the pragmatical may cenſure with Authority; for ſince a Friend may ſafely admoniſh another againſt ſuch or ſuch an ill Biaſs of Mind, a Man may alſo, according to their Notion of Reproof, innocently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a Perſon for an internal, inviſible, vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inclination, by which Reproof he inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively denominates him guilty, in ſuch or ſuch a degree of Diſcontent, Self-conceit, Envy, Vain-glory, or any the like malignant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (I ſay in ſuch or ſuch a degree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſubject of a particular <hi>Reproof</hi> muſt be viſible enough to have it's Aggravations ponder'd, that the Reſentment of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51886:26"/>may be proportion'd to the Size of the Fault) which cann't be done without paſſing Sentence upon the Heart, where none but God and Conſcience have a Right to decide Caſes: No Hypotheſis can be found which reconciles Quarrelſomneſs and Charity, Vice and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Duty and Diſobedience, and attempts to make us believe that 'tis poſſible to pleaſe God and the Devil the fame way. He who cenſures his Friend to extort Occaſions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, tho' he ſhould judge right, judges ſo but by good hap; he might as well have play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Slanderer, for Man is a very blind Judge of his Neighbour's Heart. Wherefore ſuch a Method is but doing Evil that Good may come of it; 'tis to commit Sin to do our Duty, pleaſe the Devil for fear we ſhould diſpleaſe God, a very gainleſs Entrance upon a Chriſtian Office without doubt. This is a neceſſary Caution here; for tho ſome are ſo malicious as to effect ſuch groſs and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Errors, yet there are others ignorant enough to be led aſide and deluded through Simplicity; and doubtleſs 'tis not an Entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement ſo inconſiderable that weak Minds can be quickly extricated from it. When <hi>Cenſoriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Reproof</hi> are diſſembled to be of the ſame Blood, ſcrupulous Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans will either reject the Duty, through ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Sin, or run into the Sin for love of the Duty; the latter Choice too, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51886:27"/>is the worſe, is moſt likely to be preferr'd; for ordinary Chriſtians, when they're cramp'd are apt to be dazl'd into Sin by the gaudy Proſpect of doing a good turn, when they ſhould ſtand ſtill a little, and thereby take Care not to be impos'd on by the glittering Appearance of the ſtoln Robes of Zeal, leſt when patient Examination has ſounded the Allurement, it be diſcover'd to be Sin in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe. They are raſh and turned about by Pretences, they will pretend mightily to do good by Reproof, when in Truth they re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prove not at all, but only buſie themſelves to create Miſchief and Contention, ill Words and ill Works enow by their Cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>But 2. If bare telling a Perſon of a real Fault, before his Face, is a perfect Definition of <hi>Reproof,</hi> then unmannerly Exprobration is ſo, for he that upbraids a Perſon of a Fault, muſt be own'd to tell him of that Fault. But alas! ſhould we grant Upbraiding to be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,</hi> how ſtrangely muſt we needs blacken <hi>Reproof?</hi> What a monſtrous Opinion of this excellent Duty muſt it needs beget in Men's Minds? for, according to this Standard, a treacherous Familiar, who blabs out the leſſer Faults and Infirmities of his Friend, among his Enemies, if it be but before his Face, may be ſaid to reprove.</p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51886:27"/>
                  <p>Nay, even <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Fool, the prophane Scoffer, who makes a Mock at Sin, and hits his Friend on the Teeth with his Failings, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feaſt on his Shame, and make Paſtime on his Wretchedneſs; this Burthen, I ſay, of the Community, may, with the reſt too, cloak his Villany under the fine Name of Reproof. Away therefore, with a Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, with ſuch an account of Reproof which gives Sanctuary to Atheiſtical and Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Men.</p>
                  <p>We have hitherto been ſetting a Mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Counterfeit <hi>Reproof:</hi> 'Tis Time now to ſeek out for ſome more tolerable Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of <hi>Reproof,</hi> that we may rub out thoſe Stains which ſome giddy Pretenders have ſo induſtriouſly dropt upon this excellent Duty. <hi>Reproof then, in general, is the telling any Perſon of his Fault, with a peculiar Regard to the Advancement of Virtue, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as comports with his Relation to the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who tells him of the Fault.</hi> The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the proper Methods which muſt be us'd to ſerve this great End by <hi>Reproof,</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, according to the peculiar Nature of the <hi>Reproof:</hi> For there are ſeveral kinds of Reproof, of which we muſt neceſſarily give ſome brief Account, before we can lay down a plain and clear Notion of <hi>Friendly Reproof.</hi> This therefore ſhall be done next.</p>

                  <p>ANother Cauſe which was aſſign'd for Men's wrong Notions of <hi>Friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,</hi> is their confounding it with other kinds of <hi>Reproof.</hi> Wherefore, having, I hope, already ſaid enough to rectifie their Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of <hi>Reproof</hi> in general, I beg, your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to a brief Summary of the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Reproof,</hi> together with a plain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the diſtinct Nature of every one of them, that you may with the greater Eaſe diſtinguiſh them among themſelves, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from <hi>Friendly Reproof:</hi> And to prevent Offence, I hereby deſire you to remember, That <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> is the ſole Subject of this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> and for that reaſon not to expect any Directions about the Management of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51886:28"/>others. I freely confeſs that I have no Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, neither does it become one in my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to offer Advice to Biſhops and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, neither does the Title-page promiſe to give any Rules about any but <hi>Friendly Reproof;</hi> and I hope it can be conſtrued Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in no one to pretend to underſtand the Duty of a Friend, ſince Friendſhip is a common Relation to all who obey Nature's Inſtinct to a rational Sociableneſs. In ſhort, my ſole Reaſon for mentioning the reſt is, that you may diſcriminate this from them, leſt I ſhould ſeem by urging <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> thus at large, without marking down the Diſtinctions, to confound <hi>Clerks</hi> and <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reproof</hi> is either <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Human.</hi> The <hi>Divine</hi> is General or Particular. General, as firſt, the publick denunciation of God againſt all ſin, in the Writings immediately inſpir'd by his Spirit: And ſecondly, the Conviction of Univerſal Conſcience, that innate Senſe of the Eternal Unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome Actions, which checks us in the doing them, and cauſes an Uneaſineſs in bad Men, in their firſt entrance on ſinful Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and which tears their Minds with ſuch terrible Lancinations, when they conſider and Reflect upon their Offences. Particular, as the Checks and Convictions of ev'ry Man's particular Conſcience, attended with more
<pb facs="tcp:51886:29"/>or leſs Horror or Remorſe, according to the different Circumſtances which mitigate or aggrandize the Offender's Sins, and the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Operations of the Divine Spirit, whoſe Incitements to Repentance in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Hearts, may very fairly be reckon'd one ſort of <hi>Divine Reproof.</hi> This latter is the more extraordinary <hi>Reproof;</hi> but 'tis hard, perhaps impoſſible to aſſign a Point where the natural Remorſe terminates, and the Spiritual begins. But there is no need of inſiſting on the <hi>Divine Reproof:</hi> This cannot involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be confounded with <hi>Friendly Reproof.</hi> I haſten therefore to ſpeak of the <hi>Human.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Human Reproof</hi> is of ſeveral ſorts, for there is the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi>'s [as the <hi>Prince</hi>'s and the <hi>Judge</hi>'s] the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi>'s [as the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s] the <hi>Inferior Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>'s, the <hi>Husband</hi>'s, the <hi>Parent</hi>'s, the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>'s, the <hi>Patron</hi>'s, the <hi>Maſter</hi>'s, <hi>Caſual</hi> and <hi>Friendly Reproof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt that occurs is the <hi>Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate's Reproof.</hi> To know the peculiar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Neceſſity, and (by conſequence) Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of <hi>this Reproof</hi> in general, we muſt conſider that tho' all Sins, be they greater or leſs, either in Number or Quality, make ev'ry Man a worſe Member of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth than otherwiſe he would be, yet there are ſome Offences and Crimes ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and which have ſuch a fatal aſpect
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51886:29"/>upon the Proſperity and Peace of a Kingdom, that by reaſon of the anomalous Tempers of ſome diſſociable and rapacious Wretches, there could be no ſafe or ſteddy Commerce in the World, if they were not reſtrain'd by the Shame of Publick Cognizance and the Dread of Political Sanctions, prohibiting Vices which tend directly to the unhinging Government, and quiet Neighbourhood in the World. Without the Protection of theſe Laws we could not plant in Peace, or ſow with Hope: We could neither enjoy the Fruit of our Hands, nor the Merits and Treaſures of our Anceſtors, without conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fear of violent Uſurpation, and being haſtily diſlodged, not only of our Poſſeſſions, but of our Bodies too, by Men of bloody and wild Deſires. Now the Magiſtrates are the Guardians of theſe Faithful Guardians of our Lives and Liberties: They execute their Commands, and ſo act the noble part of the Patriots of the Kingdom. This is their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Profeſſion, and a great and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one it is: Their Reproof of ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Crimes is not given ſo much for the ſake of the particular Offenders as of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and Intimacy which they have enter'd into with the Laws.</p>
                  <p>The Temporal Magiſtrate's <hi>Reproof</hi> may be divided into <hi>Royal</hi> and <hi>Judicical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51886:30"/>
                  <p>The Royal Reproof in our Monarchical, the beſt kind of, Government is, when the ſupreme Magiſtrate, either of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or in concurrence with ſome Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that great Council and Fortreſs of the Realm, the Parliament, iſſues out Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation againſt ſuch and ſuch Vices, and threatens agreeable Penalties to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone by all who commit them. Now this ſort of <hi>Admonition</hi> is General and an <hi>Implicit</hi> and <hi>unfixt Reproof,</hi> becauſe in forbidding ſuch and ſuch Practices, with Menaces annext againſt the Committers of them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it tacitly and incluſively expreſſes a Diſpleaſure againſt the ſaid Practices, and all who have indulg'd themſelves in them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' the Perſons reprov'd are unknown and unnam'd. Thus Kings are ſaid to be <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to evil doers, attending continually upon this very thing,</hi> viz. to be the <hi>avengers</hi> of the Publick <hi>upon them who do evil, that under them we may lead peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> Princes therefore reprove their Subjects for theſe Vices, as they are Fathers of their ſeveral Countries, and becauſe they have a tender concern for the Welfare and regular Order of them. Love for Souls, Affection for Religion ought to be the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Motive of all Reproof whatſoever. But that which particularizes the <hi>Prince's Reproof,</hi> is his Zeal for the good of a ſet number of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51886:30"/>Human Creatures conſider'd, as they conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the ſame Community. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that the <hi>Royal Reproof</hi> has primarily an Eye to the Temporal Proſperity of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, becauſe Communities are only cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of Temporal Rewards. They always flouriſh and decay at the long-run, according as Virtue or Vice has the greateſt Head in them. This is unavoidable; for how other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhall we be able to vindicate to our poor Apprehenſions God's Government and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Human Univerſe? What will become of the Equity of his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? <hi>Shall not the Judge of the whole Earth do right?</hi> Shall not he, whoſe Nature is the Exemplar of Virtue, confer proper Rewards on it? But if virtuous and vicious Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities cann't be rewarded and puniſh'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, our natural Notion of God's infinite Juſtice obliges us to believe that Kingdoms are more or leſs proſperous as they are more or leſs virtuous; but it is evident that it is impoſſible for Polities, as Polities, to be judg'd, rewarded or puniſhed after this ſtate. For tho' Polity itſelf will ſurvive it, yet the Polities that are now by reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Preparations which the different indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual conſtituent Parts of them make for the other World, will be then irreparably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd.

                  <p>Her moſt Gracious Majeſty (whoſe late Deceaſe turn'd our Feaſts into Mourning, and hung the Hearts of all thoſe true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who were true Friends to the <hi>Engliſh Sion,</hi> in Sackcloath) expreſs'd a maternal Care for her Subjects in thoſe Pious Letters which ſhe ſent to the Juſtices of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> for the vigorous carrying on a National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and I heartily wiſh that thoſe whoſe extraordinary Judgment, eminent Stations, and other Opportunities licences them to be guilty of ſuch an uſeful Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, as the reminding them frequently of their weighty Obligation thereunto, would pleaſure his Sacred Majeſty, the Tower of <hi>Europe,</hi> under God, by an unwearied confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to that excellent Command.

                  <p>The <hi>Judicial Reproof</hi> is the inferior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate's <hi>Reproof</hi> of any Perſon or Perſons, who are detected to be guilty of ſuch and ſuch Crimes, after they had been fairly forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them by the <hi>Royal Reproof;</hi> and becauſe that Reproof did not prove power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to keep them within Bounds, the Judge or Juſtice inflicts ſome Pecuniary or Capital Puniſhment, or other, which may for Pain and Diſgrace match the Criminal's Offence: This he is oblig'd to do, in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſupreme Magiſtrate, from whom he receiv'd his Commiſſion: 'Tis his Fidelity to his Prince, which peculiarizes his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51886:32"/>not overaw'd into Innocence by the Belief of a future Judgment, ſome are too unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to let any Government be ſecure unleſs they are brib'd by the terrible Apprehenſion of a viſible Tribunal: Nothing ſtrikes them but what is ſenſible and preſent. Since there is ſo much Diſorder even now, what would the World be but a <hi>Chaos,</hi> if ſuch Inflictions ſhould be laid aſide? Our Bleſſed Lord could never deſign Chriſtians to omit that Diſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line which Gentiles and Jews have conſtantly obſerv'd: If Chriſt has ty'd up the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate's Hands, ſo that he cann't conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly defend innocent Subjects from the Fury and Outrage of the Injurious and Blood-thirſty, 'twill be impoſſible to clear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd S. <hi>Paul</hi> from the Guilt of a Lye, who expreſly tells us, That <hi>the Power holds not the Sword in vain;</hi> which is ſuch horrid Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that it cann't be mention'd by any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Chriſtian without horror and trembling. In ſhort, Capital Puniſhments and Chriſtian Charity agree very well, ſince Malefactors are executed for no Crimes but thoſe which have a direct malign Influence upon Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: For it is unreaſonable to think that Charity can flouriſh upon the Ruins of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. The Magiſtrate being thus ſevere to ſome few, is clement and equitable to the whole.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:51886:32"/>
                  <p>But perhaps you may admire to ſee the Judge's Condemnation call'd <hi>Reproof:</hi> But however, if we look narrowly into the Uſe and Deſign of it, 'tis ſuch, and a very terrible ſort of Reproof, I confeſs: The good God grant that neither You nor I, Reader, may ever plunge our ſelves into ſuch a Depth of Guilt as to ſtand in need of this <hi>Ferula.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Judge's Condemnation is one ſort of Reproof, will appear, if we conſider, Firſt, That no Human Condemnation is a final Condemnation: And, Secondly, That thoſe notorious Malefactors (who, in all probability were ſear'd, ſo as never to have come to any ſenſe of their Spiritual Danger, and who, for that Reaſon, would, without the Application of the rigideſt Methods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have perſiſted in the pernicious Courſe of Life, ev'ry Day growing worſe and worſe, till ſome Diſaſter or other had hurried them down headlong into the nethermoſt Hell, in a deſperate and impenitent Poſture of Soul) are allow'd more or leſs Space of Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sentence of Death and the Hour of their Execution to repent in. And if we conſider, Thirdly, That the finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtopt, together with the Chariot-wheels of Life, in their Villanous Career, by the Magiſtrate's Authority, is the moſt likely means to incline ſuch obdurate Wretches
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51886:33"/>to Repentance; for if they are not utterly paſt feeling, this Conſideration muſt cut deep, and work upon them, to make the beſt Uſe of their ſorry <hi>Quantum</hi> of Time, by Reſtitution, Acts of Sorrow, Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Faith and Devotion. And farther, if we conſider, Fourthly, 'That this abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Repentance will both warn others the more ſolemnly, and give ſome Hopes of Salvation to the Offender, ſince we cann't but grant, in the Fifth Place, That the leaſt Degree of Penitence and Hope waiting upon ſuch Repentance, is far better than perfect Impenitence and Deſpair; becauſe tho' we ſhould grant that it would be no Breach of Moderation to believe that this Degree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance cann't procure Intereſt enough in the Court of Heaven to get a Ticket of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus for their Admiſſion into that Place, yet I cann't think it a piece of Raſhneſs to aſſert, That 'twill help to mitigate their Torments in Hell which does ſome Kindneſs to the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, and renders them more uſeful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Juſtice to the Spectators of their tragical End, whoſe Satisfaction, Safety and Admonition is the main End of their being executed. For the ſevereſt Infliction which does not leave thoſe, on whom it is inflicted, wholly hopeleſs, as to their Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and may ſerve to diſcourage Vice in thoſe of their Fellow-Creatures, who are
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51886:33"/>yet in a Capacity of determining God's final Sentence upon their Souls by their demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our here, either to the Satisfaction of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Juſtice, or the Pleaſure of his infinite Mercy; which capacity all the Spectators are ſtill preſum'd to be in poſſeſſion of. Nay, who knows but the eternal Incubation of God's fiery Wrath upon the Souls of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and the Damn'd, after their final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, may be one great means after the Day of Judgment of the Eternal Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Angels and Saints in their State of perfect Beatitude? What will be irreverſible Puniſhment to Fiends, will be admonition to the bleſt above, and probably of as great Uſe to the Saints and thoſe Angels who never apoſtatiz'd from God, as <hi>Reproof</hi> was to the Saints in this preparatory State, where they got the maſtery of their Corruptions. But not to digreſs, the Premiſes, I think, being ſeriouſly conſider'd, the Judge's <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Malefactors may very properly be call'd <hi>Reproof.</hi> But ſince the Judge's <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> may be properly enough term'd <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,</hi> the inferior Inflictions of the Civil Magiſtrate may very properly be plac'd in the Number of Reproof, ſince they don't ſo much as include an Abbreviature of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal's ſtay here, after which all our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to avoid the final Condemnation, or to leſſen the Weight of it will be in vain.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:51886:34"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Reproof</hi> offers it ſelf next.</p>
                  <p>'Tis two-fold. Firſt, The Biſhop's or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Magiſtrate's. Secondly, The Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Miniſters. By <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Reproof I mean the Church Cenſures; the Subjects of this <hi>Reproof</hi> are not only enormous Crimes, the Capital Laws of the Realm, but Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and avow'd Hereſie, ſcornful Contempt of the Lord's Supper, and ſuch like; becauſe any who are obſtinately Guilty of theſe Crimes, are ſcandalous Members of Chriſt's Catholick, but eſpecially of that National Church, with which they profeſs Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and are Excommunicated by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or puniſh'd by ſome lower Mulcts. according to the Aggravations of their Crime, by the Biſhops, who are the Spiritual Fathers, and do reprove ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Members thus, not only to reform them (for the blaſphemous are moſtly too obdurate to learn not to blaſpheme) but for the Credit and Safety of that Church, over which they preſide, becauſe a deſperate Diſeaſe requires a deſperate Cure. But tho' the Recovery of the ejected Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is very Hopeleſs, yet the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Church may be ſecur'd. Such ſtrict Diſcipline is neceſſary, to ſhew that the Immoralities and fantaſtick Opinions of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and Lewd Profeſſors are not encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd and ſeal'd by the Church, but are the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51886:34"/>Creatures of their own imperious Luſts and Ambitions. 'Tis neceſſary that Infectious Members ſhould be branded with a Mark of Infamy, to the end others may avoid them, 'till they are got quit of their Murrain, if they are not incurable. The Eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrate's <hi>Reproof</hi> is an Act of Fidelity to the Church, in which he is a Provincial or Dioceſan Prelate.</p>
                  <p>The Private Miniſter's Reproof is either his condemning any Sin or Sins in general before a whole Congregation; by which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation He <hi>Publickly,</hi> but, nevertheleſs, <hi>Indeterminately</hi> (for this is no proper Seaſon to apply a particular <hi>Reproof</hi>) reproves all there preſent, whoſe Conſciences teſtifie ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently againſt them: Or, ſecondly, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending particular Perſons in his Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Circuit: 'Tis his Office to reprove both in Seaſon and out of Seaſon. A fervent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour for the Improvement of his Flock in Goodneſs engages him to do this: 'Tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on him upon the account of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſception of the Paſtoral Care. The chief Subjects of his <hi>Reproof</hi> are, His Pariſhioners Neglect of the Publick Worſhip, irreverend Behaviour in the Temple, infrequent or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious Celebration of the Euchariſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Fruitleſneſs under the Ordinances, Omiſſion of Family Devotion, neglecting to inſtruct their Children in the Principles
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51886:35"/>of Religion, indifferency as to the Minds and Manners of their Servants or Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Miniſter reproves, as the Angle or Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of GOD, and as the Embaſſador of JESUS CHRIST. He is not only the Feeder but the Inſpector, Moderator and Diſcipliner of the Laity committed to his Tuition, according to the old Uſe of that known Phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and therefore a peculiar Freedom of Speech becomes him: His Gown and Unction beſpeak Veneration to his <hi>Reproof,</hi> from Perſons of all Qualities and Degrees: He may reprove often, and without Offence, and needs no familiarity with the reproved party beforehand, to gain him Authority, and Permiſſion to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to ſpeak of the <hi>Husband's Reproof.</hi> The <hi>Husband</hi> has a Right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Wife, by virtue of the conjugal Relation. He is her Superior not only by Sex and Order of Creation (for <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt form'd, then <hi>Eve</hi>) but her Lord (ſo <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> call'd <hi>Abraham</hi>) by Marriage. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subjects of his Reproof are Inſtances of wry or profuſe Management of Oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Houſhold-Affairs: The Chief End of Marriage is to procure a Family, and to keep it regular and in decent Order. The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is to provide Neceſſaries for the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and when he reproves his Wife he has a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51886:35"/>peculiar Eye to the good of his Family: He knows that the Manners and Welfare of his Children, Inferior Relations and Servants, that are under his Inſpection, hang very much upon the good or indiſcreet Conduct of his Wife, and therefore watches her Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the more cloſely, for ſhe is Governeſs of the Family juſt as he is her Governour. Hence it is, that to be much at home, has been always reputed a great Character of a Woman.</p>
                  <p>PARENTS have a Right to reprove their Children, not only becauſe they are inferior to 'em, but alſo upon the Score of a proximate and conſanguineous Relation. Their <hi>Reproofs</hi> enter with great Advantage, and therefore, if they pleaſe, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove very ſucceſsfully, and do a great deal of Good with their Tongues this way, for tender Years are eaſily ſuppled. Good God! what Cruel Monſtrous Creatures are ſome Parents, who, tho' they are call'd upon by their own Bowels, a Tenderneſs planted in them by the immediate Hand of Nature, to correct and reprove their Children (and thereby prevent ill Cuſtoms, which take faſt Poſſeſſion in green Years, when their Minds are very malleable and docile, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently tenacious of any, but eſpecially bad Impreſſions) can ſo unconcernedly let their Souls run to Ruin for want of due Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51886:36"/>and mature <hi>Reproof!</hi> Parental <hi>Reproof</hi> is an Act of Fidelity due to Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Omiſſion of it is a horrid Crime indeed. 'Tis a hard Caſe that thoſe who have not Judgment enough to make clear Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions between Good and Evil, ſhould be nurs'd up for Hell, only for want of ſuch a cheap Alms as <hi>Reproof,</hi> and that too from thoſe who brought them into the World. How many Children may at the laſt accuſe their Parents of having coupled together meerly to gratifie natural Inſtinct? Sure ſuch Parents don't conſider that theſe corrupt Off-ſprings of theirs are obnoxious to Eternal Damnation, unleſs good Counſels dye their Minds betimes with good Tempers. After one overgrown Vice has beggar'd, another diſgrac'd, a third diſeas'd their Children, and all together have Rack'd and Tortur'd their Minds with reſtleſs Paſſions and ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but fruitleſs Agonies; then you may hear them cry, That they're heartily ſorry that they were ſo neglectful: But alas! then 'tis too late, then their own and their forlorn Poſterity's Curſes are the juſt and dire Rewards of their barbarous Fondneſs.</p>

                     <hi>T<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TORS</hi> are the Vice parents of their Pupils, and therefore by reproving them they not only conſult the Honour of their own Inſtructions and Methods of Education, but alſo approve themſelves faithful both in the Sight of God and Men, to their natural Parents, who truſt their Children in their Hands; which is the chief Circumſtance that ſpecifies a Tutor's <hi>Reproof.</hi>

'Twas their own and their Parents Contract, That they ſhould live in Obedience. 'Tis from their Maſters that they learn to get a handſome Subſiſtence in the World, by Skill and Induſtry in ſome honeſt Calling; and therefore 'tis great Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Ingratitude in them to be ſtubborn and ſurly when they are reprov'd. The Chriſtian Doctrine aſſures us, That Servants ſhould be ſubject, not only to the good and gentle, but even to froward Maſters, and conſtrues it no Glory (ſo eaſie and fitting is it) to be patient when they are chaſtiz'd for their Faults.

                     <hi>Reproof</hi> may be call'd <hi>Caſual</hi> when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover neither reproves as a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> nor as a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> nor as a <hi>Husband,</hi> nor as a <hi>Parent,</hi> nor as a <hi>Tutor,</hi> nor as a <hi>Patron,</hi> nor as a <hi>Maſter:</hi> In ſhort, upon no other Obligation or Relation than thoſe general ones of the <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Fellow-Creature,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> 'Tis call'd <hi>Caſual,</hi> becauſe 'tis given by Chance, without Fore-thought, nay ſometimes without knowing what the Perſon is whom we reprove: There is no Plot laid beforehand, no Seaſon pitch'd upon, no Opportunity watch'd for; but the Offender is reprov'd without Stratagem and Preface upon the Spot. The Subjects of this Reproof are (to uſe S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Phraſe) <hi>works of Darkneſs;</hi> that is to ſay, Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are not ſit or tolerable to be ſpoke in Company, or to be done in the Sight of the Sun; ſuch as are too offenſive to be born with by the Light, unleſs among the Scum or brutiſher Part of Mankind.

There is but little Hope of ſuch Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reform'd by ſuch Reproof, and therefore they are not reprov'd ſo much for their own ſakes as for the Company's good and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51886:38"/>A Man muſt expreſs his Abhorrence of Atheiſm and Licentious Talk, as he is but a ſociable Creature; for there can be no continuance of ſound Society, unleſs ſuch exorbitant Tenets and Practices are openly and unexceptionably diſcourag'd and explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in all Company. Theſe are the horrid Sins in which the Apoſtle ſo far diſallows of our Partaking with the Committers of them, that he commands us to reprove the Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Scornful Abettors of them, who ſhake Hands with Wiſdom to paſs for Wits; and indeed, not to reprove them, is in ſome degrees to be Partakers of their Sins. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, without doubt, is Connivance in ſuch a Caſe, and therefore a perillous Omiſſion of one of the main poſitive Duties of the Tongue. What Love can that Man have for exemplary Virtue, who does not find himſelf provok'd by ſuch notorious Vice, and freely vent his Abhorrence of deteſtable, barefac'd and impudent Wickedneſs, when God and Religion are made Themes of Jeſt and ſcurrilous Raillery? 'Tis true, there is a furious and over-haſty Zeal, which is devoid of Prudence, and therefore not commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but 'tis alſo certainly true that there is a publick and generous Zeal, that is conſiſtent with Civility, Prudence and good Manners. Lukewarm People may talk as they pleaſe, and harangue very much in Commendation
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51886:39"/>of Prudence, whilſt, in the mean while they donn't ſo much as underſtand wherein true Prudence conſiſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DENCE</hi> is the wary and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Application of that Degree of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which we have in the induſtrious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of thoſe Deſigns which we are moſt ambitious to ſee accompliſh'd. The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Wiſdom and Prudence is this. Wiſdom is Knowledge, as it is treaſur'd up and lies unactive in the Intellect. Prudence is the eliciting it into Action, the ſeaſonable Uſe of it upon an Emergency. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this practical Faculty of Circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is us'd to different Purpoſes, according to our different Degrees of Faith. Thoſe whoſe Belief and Aſſent flows ſolely from their Eyes, that is to ſay, who are purely ſenſual, employ it to diſhoneſt Ends, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their Inclinations, to enjoy thoſe things which ſeem beautiful and lovely to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſuch as Covetouſneſs, Ambition and Vain-glory, becauſe the praiſe of Men pleaſes our Ears, and a Heap of Riches is pleaſant to the Eye. Now their dextrous Uſe of this comparative Faculty to ſuch Ends is, properly ſpeaking, nothing but Carnal, Unlawful Prudence, or, to expreſs it in one Word, Craft, which proceeds from a culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Self-love, a partial Love of themſelves, conſider'd abſtractly from the Human Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51886:39"/>merely as they are ſenſitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ally'd to Brutes. Such Men act with a ſole regard to that groſs Body which they will wear only in this periſhing State; and therefore will do nothing which tends at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preſent to the diminiſhing their Wealth or the Shipwrack of their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Crowd (which, if we would pleaſe in an Age when moſt are lewd, we muſt omit many Duties, the Obſervance of which would promote the Honour of God, and the Spiritual Grandeur of our own Minds) tho' indeed they will many times ſcorn the good Opinion of their Fellow-Creatures, if they cann't enjoy it, and ſome vile Gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the ſame Time: And without Doubt their Sentence muſt be dreadful at the laſt Day, who think that Credit is too coſtly a Victim to be devoted to God, which they can very readily ſacrifice to their own Luſts. But thoſe whoſe Faith is more extenſive, and is freed from the Fetters of Senſe, who have a commanding Senſe of the Divine Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, whoſe Underſtandings and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made more ſpacious by the Proſpect of a future State, who really believe that God is Spirit, and that the Similitude of God is ſtamp'd on that part of their being, which is ſo bright and fine that it eſcapes the Sight of our bodily Eyes. Thoſe, thoſe, I ſay, ſubject the Eſtimation of their Body
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51886:40"/>to that of their Soul, and, in ſhort, make their Temporal ſeeming Intereſt give way for the Advancement of Religion, and the continuance of the Honour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence of God with them, in which their real and eternal Intereſt is wrapp'd up. In them the Uſe of their natural Faculty of comparing Circumſtances is, in the Dialect of God and Nature call'd Prudence. Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Lovers of Self abuſe this Faculty: They who love themſelves ſubordinately to the Love of God, that is to ſay, love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not as ſole, ſeparate, independent Beings, but as being related to God and his Creation, uſe it wiſely and religiouſly. We are in the firſt Place to take care that our Love of God be the ſupreme Love, that we may ply all our Faculties to his Glory, like truly affectionate Creatures; and ſince <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof</hi> may promote his Glory, we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. Now the knowing and being fully ſatisfied that the Promotion of his Glory ought to be our firſt Aim and chief Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> Moreover, ſince he is a God to Order and Seaſon in his Works, and has inveſted Humanity with a proper Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to diſtinguiſh Circumſtances and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that our wiſe Ends and Endeavours may prove ſucceſsful, 'tis incumbent upon us not only to reprove, but to take Care to reprove at fit Times and in a fit manner,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51886:40"/>which is the Exertion of Prudence. And whenever we reprove without due regard to Seaſon, tho' our <hi>Reproof</hi> may prove as clear from carnal Prudence, and ſhews that we have more regard for the Univerſal Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion than our own private Eſteem among others; yet we may very properly then be ſaid to be imprudent, and thus a Man may be wiſe without Prudence. On the contrary, thoſe who don't reprove when they might have done it, without any Breach of what Reaſon calls Civility, being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally prudent, may very well be ſaid to be prudent without Wiſdom. But the truly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect Chriſtian is both wiſe and prudent: He will nether let the Offender eſcape his Reproof, nor reprove an Offender in the heighth of Paſſion, or when his Faculties are ſupplanted by Intemperance, not becauſe Reproof will diſpleaſe them then (for the Wicked are diſpleaſed with it when they are ſober) but becauſe if he conſult the Nature of things he cann't but know that in ſuch a caſe no good purpoſe can be anſwer'd by the hazzarding his Reputation, and that unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and miſapply'd Reproofs (eſpecially if they are of a caſual nature) do more Miſchief to the Credit of the Duty it ſelf than could have been ſatisfied for by all the Good which it might have done, tho' it had been well manag'd, and crown'd with deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51886:41"/>Succeſs. But now I am ſpeaking of Seaſon, I muſt inform you, That your Rules of Seaſonableneſs muſt be fetch'd from the Dictates of Nature, not from the unconſtant deprav'd Humors of ſome Men, for he that thus obſerves the Wind ſhall not ſow. We are not to reprove only where we foreſee it will probably find a welcom acceſs, or omit this Duty upon the proſpect of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably being reproach'd for it: But our Care ought to be this, never to reprove where or when ſome Circumſtances conſider'd, our Reproof, by being a greater Breach of Decency than it can poſſibly be an Act of Duty, will be not merely in the Opinions of ill Men, but by the Laws of Nature Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach-worthy. A raſh Reproof repreſents a Man inconſiſtent with himſelf, becauſe it repreſents him an extraordinary forward Zealot, before he has learn'd to ſhew himſelf a Man by Conſideration, which is to invert the Order of God and Nature: For Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is one of the firſt Virtues, in order, and his Zeal cann't be well founded, who is deſtitute of it; ſo that the Raſhneſs demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that Zeal to he ill grounded, which the Reproof ſeems to expreſs. To which give me Leave to add, That the Obſervance of Caution and Seaſon in giving <hi>Reproof</hi> will free us from being charg'd with Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory and Arrogance by any candid or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51886:41"/>Chriſtian for our <hi>Reproof.</hi> In ſhort, We muſt firſt be ſure to have excellent Aims, and then ſtudy to ſerve them by proper means. But tho' we are not to reprove every Perſon whom we know to be a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Sinner, or one who is ſuperior to us in Age, quality or Function, yet we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove any one to whom we are equal enough to be their Companion, if they do any thing that is ſcandalous while we are in their Company. The Canons of common Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will Authorize us to reprove them: We may, without committing any Soleciſm in Addreſs, beg their Silence, and freely vent our Diſpleaſure. For if we are equal enough to be Companions, we are in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Society ſociable upon equal Terms, and on the ſame Conditions: And therefore ev'ry Companion may ſpeak his Mind in his Turn, and take notice of what offends him, without miniſtring any juſt occaſion of Offence, how ill ſoever Men, that have no Senſe of the excellent Nature of Charity to their Souls, may be apt to take it. Why may not good Men conſult their lawful Eaſe and Liberty as well as the Licentious? We may eaſily level the Matter, by but putting the Caſe plainly. Should a well-meaning Chriſtian be ſo imprudently zealous (when he has by Chance or Neceſſity fell into ſome Company who have little or no Love
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51886:42"/>for Goodneſs, or perhaps are bitter and ſacramental Enemies to it) as to offer at a Diſcourſe about Angels, the future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Benefit of Contemplation and heavenly Things, Self-reflection, or ſome extraordinary Favours with which the Holy Ghoſt has oblig'd his Soul, or any ſublime and practical Topicks which ſuch vitiated Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates cann't reliſh without Diſguſt, and ought only to be introduc'd in ſelect Converſation and extraordinary Times, when our Minds are beſt ſeaſon'd, would they not preſently begin to hiſs, and bid him leave off Canting, and tell him that was not a Place to preach in! I donn't queſtion they'd preſently inform him, without thinking it any Invaſion upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that he did but expoſe himſelf to them by ſo doing. Why then may not a fervent Chriſtian, when his Sacred Ears are aſſaulted with Curſes, Blaſphemy and Obſcenity, modeſtly beg the Favour not to be detain'd and diſturb'd with their Sins and Follies, and tell them he takes ſuch Demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as an Affront, and for that Reaſon deſire them to compound to talk about ſomething that is uſeful, which is neither ſinful in its own Nature, nor has an immediate Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to heavenly things, lyes between two Extremes, and will proſit both without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending either? When the Prophane are very unſeaſonably Wicked, a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51886:42"/>exemplary Life conſtitutes him their Superior, and the Miniſter's Deputy upon the Account of his Innocence, and for that Reaſon authorizes him to reprove them, without waiting for a privater Seaſon. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Impudence makes an uncommon and publick Reproof a juſt Correction of the reprov'd, and a ſeaſonable Act in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion who reproves, tho' he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s no farther related to him than as he partakes of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, has been baptiz'd, and is but a caſual Companion at the inſtant of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof: And therefore, to omit Reproof at ſuch a Time is to neglect a decent Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of expreſſing our Zeal for God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and therefore is as blameable as to have no regard for Seaſon at all. In ſhort, we muſt remember that Prudence has its Boundaries as well as Zeal, and it requires as much Spiritual Judgment to aſſign the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Limits of the one as of the other: 'Tis as neceſſary to have Zeal enough to ſay to the Soul, <hi>Hitherto thou ſhalt go,</hi> as it is to have Prudence to add, <hi>no farther.</hi> Where there is no Zeal for God, our Prudence can't be Spiritual and Chriſtian. Luxuriant, or, to ſpeak more properly, an unſeaſonable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of Zeal makes a Man prodigal of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Reproofs, and carnal Caution makes him too ſtingy, and therefore Prudence without Zeal is as certainly ſinful as Zeal
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51886:43"/>that is not rein'd by Prudence, is but a falſe Image of Divine Love, and which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to be reputed a Zeal that is mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ſome exceſſive Heat of an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Brain, than the genuine emanation of Chriſtian Charity. Is not therefore the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Omiſſion of this Duty, my Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Countreymen, a great Fault in you? Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Reproof may ſilence if not reform; make Wretches leſs contagious to others, tho' not leſs wiſe and religious themſelves. I dare be poſitive, that wicked Men, how brazen ſoever the ill Complexions of their Minds may be, would not have ſuch callous Countenances, if the Virtuous did but aſſume their rightful Boldneſs. Vice would not ſneak and lower it's Head by Degrees, juſt as it got Ground through the Neglect of this Duty. But you may tell me, That the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of caſual Reproof is antiquated and quite out of date now, and therefore to, bring it up would look ridiculous, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe who ſhould attempt it. But give me leave to acquaint thee, Chriſtian, that tho' the Heavens themſelves will be ſhrivel'd like Parchment before the Fire, yet Reaſon, and that God, who is the Author of Reaſon, and has made this a Duty, will never grow old: No, as he always was and ſtill is, ſo he will be always omnipotent and immutable; for which Reaſon they that trample upon his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51886:43"/>Laws cannot eſcape his Wrath, unleſs they repent, whilſt Repentance and Reproof will be accepted, and will contribute to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Felicity of Human Creatures. If the Herd are ſo brutiſh as to deſpiſe, through Ignorance or Wickedneſs ſuch an excellent Duty, the wiſe and ſincere Profeſſors of the Religion of the Bleſſed Jeſus have the more Reaſon to exerciſe caſual Reproof, ſince there is ſuch a great and lamentable Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for it. You, I ſpeak to, the brave and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Diſciples of my once Crucified, but now Glorified Lord, are hereby call'd to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice your Temporal Credit for Chriſt, and that Virtue of which he was both the Principal Pattern and Patron, and will you ſhamefully deſert'em in a Time of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity? Do you really believe, that he, who, many hundred Years ago, ſaid theſe Words, <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and ſay all manner of evil againſt you, falſly, for my name's ſake: Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven,</hi> knew what a weighty Truth he ſpake? Cowardiſe and Inconſideration may, but a Heart's Affection for Religion will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver away with the Neglect of Caſual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. Where is your Faith and Chriſtian Magnanimity, who are ſo baſely aſham'd of Chriſt's Cauſe? One that cann't patienly bear with the Frowardneſs of Ignorant and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51886:44"/>Malicious Men, may aſſure himſelf without the Gift of Prophecy, that he is not arm'd with a Spirit of Martyrdom againſt thoſe Storms and Tempeſts which may one Day ſift his Faith. If you deny and are aſham'd of Chriſt before Men, he will diſown and be aſham'd of you alſo before his Father, Angels and Men at the laſt. Meaſures of Decency are not as in Matters of common Actions which relate to this Life, to be taken in matters of Duty and Religion, firm t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Notions and Cuſtoms of the <hi>moſt,</hi> becauſe it may be ſafely ſaid, That the moſt have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been the worſt. Singular Examples are not fit to be conſtant and univerſal Rules, much leſs the Lives of the Common If you think that we muſt act with the moſt always, for the ſake of Peaceableneſs, why don't you lye and equivocate, carry your ſelves irreverently in God's Houſe, trifle with the tremendous Name, turn your Backs upon the Altar of Divine Love, and ſuch like, ſince the moſt do ſo? Reprove therefore the Works of Darkneſs. When one ſtands up in the behalf of Virtue the reſt will in all likelihood back and ſecond him; but if the Company ſhould be mute, nay hiſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile you, they'l cancel their Scoffs when the Pitcher is broken at the Fountain, and the Wheel at the Ciſtern, when the Evil Days come and the Years draw nigh; and they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51886:44"/>ſhall ſay, We have no Pleaſure in them. Farther, This is the ſureſt way to be rid of their troubleſome Company: 'Twill be Matter of Comfort too, to reflect that a Duty has been diſcharg'd, a Duty too, which is in a great meaſure expenſive of our Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the deareſt to good Men of all Temporal Goods, in an Age wherein Virtue is made matter of Satyr. However, 'tis neither Sin nor Folly, Diſſociableneſs nor Incivility to offend thoſe who will conſtrue the greateſt Kindneſſes Offences, and whom we cann't pleaſe without committing Sin, without the Loſs of God's Favour, deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtue's good Name when 'tis aſſaſſin'd, and without the Decay of our own Soul's Health. Do your Duty therefore chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and doubt not, notwithſtanding the Wicked may now <hi>call your Life Madneſs,</hi> that <hi>Wiſdom will be juſtified of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This may ſuffice to ſuggeſt the uſe of this ſort of Reproof, and of all the reſt. I could willingly ſpeak more largely of the latter, but <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> is what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to handle particularly now, and the true Reaſon why I have inſiſted upon the other was to remove Men's groſs Errors about it. I think my ſelf very happy that they have let me arrive, tho with ſo much Trouble and Difficulty, to the Harbour of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51886:45"/>my Wiſhes, and the moſt delicious Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Thoughts. Now we may enjoy our ſelves without the leaſt Alloy of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and of any but affected Miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Now <hi>Friendly Reproof,</hi> a golden and lovely Subject, indeed; that great, but deſpis'd Benefactor of Religion, is ready to receive our eager Embraces.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Friendly Reproof is the Reproof given by a Friend to a Friend.</hi> The particular End of this Reproof is the Perfection of the Soul of that individual who is reprov'd. One pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Property of it is it's being always given privately. It may happen indeed that a Friend may need to be reprov'd in Publick; but then he is reproved, in ſuch a caſe, upon the account of ſome more extenſive Relation than that of a Friend. And as none but a Friend is the Object of <hi>Friendly Reproof,</hi> and none but a Friend can properly give it, ſo the Subjects of it are not only groſs Faults, but even Specks and leſs diſcernible Failures: For the Conſiderate would have their Friends not only abſtain from heinous Sins, but from all Appearances and Beginnings of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. 'Tis their flaming Ambition that their Friends may not only not be legible Pictures of the great Enemy of Souls, but that they may ev'ry Day lay aſide ev'ry Incumbrance, and grow nearer and nearer to the Nature of good Angels. This ſort of Reproof is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51886:45"/>with an extraordinary Affection, a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Force and Stream of Benevolence. 'Tis an Act of Fidelity in him that reproves to his own Truſt, Pretences and Contract; an Act of Love and Gratitude to the Manhood of the reprov'd conſider'd as his peculiar Fellow-Helper and Well-Wiſher.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have been taken up with the diſtinguiſhing the particular Kinds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, the neglect of which has been one main Fountain of erroneous Judgments about the Nature of <hi>Friendly Reproof;</hi> for how many ſhall you hear excuſing themſelves for not reproving their Friends, becauſe they are neither Magiſtrates nor Miniſters whoſe Duty it is to reprove? whereas had theſe Perſons but obſerved this Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they would have known that it was one thing to reprove as a Magiſtrate, or a Miniſter, and another to reprove as a Friend.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter with two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of which is, That ſometimes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of theſe ſorts of Reproof may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident in the ſame Perſon: Thus, to give one very plain Inſtance, a Biſhop may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a Sin before a whole Congregation, in the hearing of a particular Friend of his, to which this Friend is very much addicted: Here he reproves him in general, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately, as a Miniſter. After Sermon
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51886:46"/>he, in the next Place, knowing this Friend to be guilty of the Sin, goes and reproves him for it privately and particularly as a Friend. But if, notwithſtanding his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Rebukes, and the application of other prudent Methods, to recover him, his Friend repeats and repeats this Sin, ſo long till by degrees it betrays him into more heinous Commiſſions, and he by that means prove a ſcandalous Example, the Biſhop is oblig'd to excommunicate this dear Friend, as he would conſcientiouſly diſcharge the Duty of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or Eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrate. But tho' they may be coincident in Caſes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet for the moſt part they are not ſo, and Error being harder to be detected than Truth is to be diſcover'd, 'twas neceſſary in an Engagement with prejudic'd Perſons that our Entrance into this Subject might be made the ſmoother to ſpeak of ev'ry one of them apart, and to mark down the particular Characteriſticks of all of them diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>But, ſecondly, to conclude this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince there are different Uſes of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of <hi>Reproof,</hi> 'tis evident that the Reformation and Improvement of the reprov'd Perſon (tho' 'tis always to be charitably wiſh'd and hop'd for) is not the ſole End of all <hi>Reproof.</hi> Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That though a Man could be ſafely
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51886:46"/>confident (which cann't be without a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and a Violation of Charity, <hi>which,</hi> as S <hi>Paul</hi> acquaints us, <hi>hopes all things</hi>) that an Offender, whom he has a Right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove upon ſome of the precedent Accounts, will be never the better for his Reproof, yet this can be no ſafe Pretext for his omiſſion of it, in not making a patient Experiment upon ſuch an Offender, ſince his Reproof may, ſuppoſing the worſt, be often inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the promotion of Virtue in other Reſpects, as has been ſhewn in the Caſe of caſual Reproof, the Temporal Magiſtrate's Condemnation, and the Spiritual Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate's Excommunication, which is the principal End of all <hi>Reproof</hi> whatſoever, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at large.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Friendſhip is a Natural Relation, that is to ſay, A Relation which Man by Nature ſtands in need of. And, 2. That no Man can diſcharge the Duty of a Man in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Friendſhip, without reproving his Friend ſometimes; then queſtionleſs <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> is a Natural and Human Duty. Now
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51886:48"/>the Truth of both theſe Propoſitions I dare undertake to prove.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I prove that Friendſhip is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Relation. Our unavoidable Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on one another in this State, ſo full of Dangers and pregnant of Neceſſities, which are too many and too tough to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd and foreſtall'd by the wiſeſt, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt induſtrious Man's ſolitary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, continually minds us that we are ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creatures by Nature. This common Principle of Sociableneſs is the univerſal Cement of all Mankind: Deſerts are too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable to Man to be meaſur'd out for his Abode. But tho' all Men are ſociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by Nature, yet it is impoſſible for any Man to aſſiſt and aſſociate with all Men any other wiſe than as they form one Human Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, one Rational Orb. All Men cann't be helpful to all Men <hi>perſonally,</hi> tho' in reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Man they ſhould be <hi>intentionally,</hi> and are, <hi>ipſo facto, centrally</hi> aſſiſtant to all Men. Our Benevolence may extend to all, tho' our Beneficence cannot. Nevertheleſs, ev'ry Man has a Power to be actually Helpful to a ſmall Number of his Fellow Creatures, more or leſs, this way or that way, and ſome moſt, I might have ſaid all ways, according to the Stature and Capacity of their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Faculties, and the different Vigour and Tendency of their ſeveral Genius's. Thus,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51886:48"/>by the communicative Powers of individuals in different Employments all neceſſary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are upheld, and all carry on the ſame End, their own comfortable Subſiſtence and the ſupport of the whole Human Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: By the happy Concurrencies of ev'ry diſtinct few in the Aiding of a few, all Men become in the End the Auxiliaries of all Men, conſider'd as they are clad with the ſame Nature and Members of the whole Human Univerſe. Hence it was that the World was no ſooner ſtock'd with Inhabitants, but Men very willingly, from the beginning of the World even to this Day, agreed to channel themſelves into Empires, Kingdoms, Shires, Cities, Towns, Neighbourhoods and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable other leſs Societies and Branches of Polity. 'Tis alſo this Neceſſity which is the Foundation of perſonal Relations. Civil Magiſtrates are neceſſary to preſerve diſtinct Bodies and Governments from Diſorder and Ruin. Marriages are neceſſary to erect a new Poſterity in ev'ry Age, and for the more careful Education of Children. The Relation of Maſters and Servants is neceſſary too for the Continuance and Improvement of all uſeful Arts and Sciences, which are Inſtruments of Subſiſtence, Ornament and Convenience, to both our Minds and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:51886:49"/>
                  <p>I But ſince none of theſe Relations and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions of Magiſtrate and Plebeian, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, Parent, and Child, Maſter and Servant allow ſpecial equality enough in their Correlates to admit of that Intimacy which ev'ry Man's want of Conſultation in Doubts, and thoſe numerous Straits and Dangers which Men of all Vocations and in all Circumſtances are expos'd to, together with ev'ry Man's natural eagerneſs to empty his Boſom of his ſecret Joys and Grievances require, Nature is bound, upon Peril of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproach'd, together with that God who is the Author of Nature, for haying made Man his own Burthen, and the ſupreme Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of all ſublunary Creatures, utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of moderate Comfort, to procure him another Correlate. 'Tis true, a Man and his Wife are ſo near that they may, in one Senſe be ſaid to be one: They have the ſame Family and Main Chance to take Care of, but they drive on this ſame End diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ways. Women are not fit to give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, nor, generally ſpeaking, able to lend a helping Hand in Maſculine Affairs; and yet the Woman's Part may be play'd well enough. Beſides, a Wife is ſeldom ſo diſcreet as ſhe ſhould be, and very few Men will truſt their Wives with the Key of their Boſom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know that 'tis not convenient for ev'ry one to ſee what is laid up in that Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51886:49"/>Nay, ſhould a Wife be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Woman and a great Bleſſing (which few now-a-days are) ſo as to ſerve not only for a Wife, but for a Friend, yet ſhe is but one; and he that has her would do well to prize her; and if ſhe be Loving and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and keep a ſtrict Eye over her Family, ſuppoſing ſhe be far from being ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Wife, ſhe is nevertheleſs to be cheriſh'd and belov'd, ſince ſhe is, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a good Wife, becauſe Strength of Thought, a ſevere Diſcipline of Tongue, and ſtrong Hands are not common to the Female Sex. But to return, be ſhe ever ſo extraordinary, as I have before ſaid, ſhe is but one, and one aſſiſtant cannot be rely'd on: One Perſon's Counſel will not ſuffice to furniſh a Man with Prudence, and to mould his Mind into a juſt equanimity in all Emergencies. Man's Affairs are not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd either by one or by a multitude of, but by two or three, private Counſellors. Whoſoever therefore are not ſo unuſually Happy as to have wiſe Brethren by Blood, that are born for Adverſity, muſt adopt the ſincereſt and prudenteſt Equals they can get acquainted with for their Brethren; thoſe Brethren, I mean, who are commonly call'd Friends; who will joyn <hi>Heads,</hi> and <hi>Hearts,</hi> and <hi>Hands,</hi> not only in Proſperity, but when Storms and Tempeſts do induce Melancholy
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51886:50"/>and Terror, and Fearfulneſs, and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, get faſt hold of our Spirits, who (as my Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> has excellently well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd) <hi>redouble our Joys and ſplit our Griefs in two,</hi> who (than which I cann't add a greater Encomium) as <hi>Solomon</hi> acquaints, <hi>do ſtick cloſer to one another than Brother to Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> In ſhort, Friendſhip is ſo neceſſary to make our Joys real and permanent, and to pillar up our Spirits in gloomy Days (which will certainly come in their turns) that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Nature obliges us to believe that Friendſhip is a Natural Relation.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The ſecond Propoſition to be prov'd, is this. No Man can diſcharge the Duty of a Man in the Relation of Friendſhip without his reproving his Friend ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>To render this Truth apparent, 'tis requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and accordingly I deſire you to conſider theſe three things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That <hi>Reproof</hi> is a great Act of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</item>
                     <item>2. That 'tis an Act of Kindneſs, which ev'ry Man ſtands more or leſs in need of.</item>
                     <item>3. 'Tis an Act of Kindneſs, that ev'ry Man is capable of doing for his Friend.</item>
                  </list>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:51886:50"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, I ſay, We ſhould conſider, That <hi>Reproof</hi> is a great Act of Kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>Natural Light informs us very clearly, and common Experience witneſſes that there are Actions and Habits, which gall Man's Mind, cheapen his Name, waſte his Eſtate, impair his Health, ſtraiten his Faculties, and make him laviſh of that Time which was given him to improve his being in: And farther, Natural Light does as clearly ſatisfie us that ſuch Actions and Habits are Hurtful and Evil to Man: Neither God nor Nature can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, nay not condemn what diſquiets us and ſerves no good End: Of this kind are all Extremes, as <hi>immoderate Sleep, Eating, Drinking, Sociableneſs, Solitude, Talking, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, Grief, Joy, Anger,</hi> and the like. Agreeably the Heathens themſelves ſeated all Virtue in general and Mediocricy: <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio tutiſſimus ibis</hi> is a Proverb in ev'ry School-Boy's Mouth: So far they were very well acquainted with the Nature of Human Virtue.</p>
                  <p>But ſince we can find by the natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of theſe Actions and Habits, that they are ſo many ways hurtful to us, the Bane and Burthen of our being, we muſt grant that the Removal and Prevention of ſuch Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and Actions is a great Act of Human Kindneſs. For certainly nothing is a great
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51886:51"/>Act of Kindneſs if that is not ſuch which contributes in a great Meaſure to the Health of our Bodies, the Peace of our Conſciences, the Preſervation of our Credit, the regular Steerage of our Faculties, and finally the wiſe Diſpenſation of all our Time, to the Advancement always, more or leſs of our entire Man.</p>
                  <p>Now Private and <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> does contribute very much to the Removal of ſuch Habits and Actions. The removal of them is the only Aim of <hi>Friendly Reproof;</hi> and truly 'tis a means as fair as any for Succeſs in ſuch an Attempt. For Reproof is always given with ſome Signs of uneaſineſs, and ev'ry Man highly valuing one whom he takes to be his ſincere Friend, reveres his Diſpleaſure. The Expreſſion of Anger in his Friend makes the reprov'd Perſon conclude with himſelf, That that Fault which cauſes ſuch Anger in his cordial well-wiſher can be no ſuch inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Evil as an inconſiderate Sinner, is apt to think it; which Concluſion excites Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for it: And pungent Reflections cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Horror of it for the future, and that Horror makes him ſeal the Will with firm Reſolutions againſt it, which is the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to guard the Soul againſt all the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the Devil. By this Method, if his Fault was a ſingle Act of any particular Sin, the Seeds of an ill Habit are choak'd;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51886:51"/>but if the Sin for which he was reprov'd was habitual, this Reproof will animate him to labour with all his Might by Severities upon himſelf and Conſultation with others, and, above all, by frequent and earneſt Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace, to demoliſh the ſtrong Holds of the Devil. What is there ſo difficult that a Man will not aſſay, in order to keep up the Love and favourable Opinion of his Friend, who by daily Endearments and Obligations does manifeſt his Kindneſs to be real and hearty? and ſure Sins, if they are view'd when the Mind is in it's Meridian, will not appear to the ſedater Thoughts ſo lovely that a Friend ſhould rather be parted with than them. If a Friend has little Love for his Soul, from a brutiſh Ignorance of it's Worth, yet a Friend's Diſpleaſure may force him to ſhake Hands with a Vice and his Darling Vice too, perhaps.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, As, a Friend's <hi>Reproof</hi> is a great Act of Kindneſs, ſo 'tis an Act of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which ev'ry one, more or leſs, ſtands in need of.</p>
                  <p>A Good and Circumſpect Man May live above the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>'s <hi>Reproof,</hi> nay out of the Reach of the envenom'd Arrows of helliſh Tongues, and above the Comments of the Envious and Pragmatical, and yet be girt about with many dangerous Infirmities, which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51886:52"/>his Friend, who is often with him, can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſpy out. There is not that warieſt Man alive who offends not: <hi>The righteous,</hi> it ſeems, <hi>offends ſeven times a day,</hi> that is to ſay, frequently, but then this muſt be explain'd rather of inviſible than viſible Faults. Nevertheleſs the beſt Men have their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Faults, even thoſe that are Lights to the World have their Spots and Littleneſſes, which thoſe who are often near and intent upon them, may eaſily diſcern and count up without a Pick fault Inclination. They are Lectures of Humility to great Examples. Where is the Man that is perfectly Innocent and Virtuous, to omit the Refinements of the Goſpel, in Nature's and a ſecond Man's Eyes? But tho' the beſt Men confine upon, nay ſlip into ſome of thoſe Extreams which are the Peſts of Humanity, yet it was not convenient that all the Miſeries and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of good Souls in this State, ſhould be uncurtain'd to the Crowd, becauſe then the Reputation of the brighteſt Example of Virtue would ſuffer a very diſmal Cloud, and ſo miſs of that Efficacy it has upon ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Spectators. But tho' if thoſe leſſer Faults were viſible to all that tranſiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, the Luſtre of their Credits would be eclips'd in the Eyes of the World, yet God and Friends can have Generoſity enough to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51886:52"/>Pity, Heal and Pardon thoſe retir'd Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, without being alienated from the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And indeed ſince we cannot ſay he is happieſt who offends not at all, becauſe this is abſurdly to ſuppoſe what never will be, ſince no Man ever was, is, or will be ſo happy in this State, as not to offend at all; we muſt be content to ſay, He is the happieſt Man who offends leaſt. This is an Ambition which every Man ſhould ſuffer to bear the Sceptre in his own Breaſt. Now that this ſort of Ambition in our Friends may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, we ſhould acquaint them with thoſe Faults which are viſible to us: For indeed many of good Men's ſmalleſt Faults are not ſo diſcernible to themſelves as to their Friends; ſo that unleſs thoſe who are ofteneſt with, and profeſs Kindneſs for them, tell them of their Faults, which they note in them, they will in all probability eſcape their Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, and conſequently their Vigilance, whereby they are depriv'd of being ſo many degrees nearer to perfection. But I am ſure if the beſt Men ſtand in need of <hi>Friendly Reproof,</hi> others, but eſpecially thoſe who deſerve <hi>Caſual</hi> and ſeverer <hi>Reproofs,</hi> ſtand much more in need of <hi>Friendly Reproof.</hi> The natural Corollary of which is, that all Men conſider'd in their preſent Capacity of bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Candidates,</hi> not <hi>Maſters</hi> of rational Perfection, are the Objects of the Relief of <hi>Friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51886:53"/>
                  <p n="3">3. But thirdly, <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> is an Act of Kindneſs which ev'ry Man is capable of doing for his Friend.</p>
                  <p>We have all, even the Ignoranteſt of us, a natural Capacity to perceive the Eternal Unreaſonableneſs and intrinſically evil Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſome Actions and Habits. Happy, happy ſhould we all be, if we did but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly avoid the Commiſſion of all thoſe Sins, which becauſe of their Uglineſs and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we cann't avoid knowing to be Sins. And as the Senſe of the chief Subjects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion is wrought in our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: by Nature, ſo we have alſo a natural Aptneſs and Sagacity to ſee theſe Extremes ſooner and better in others than in our ſelves. There is a due Diſtance of the Object, and a due hatred of the Sin which we ſee: Self-love and Partiality don't blind and corrupt our Judgments Abroad as they do at Home. Jealouſie for our Friend's Welfare, Hatred of Sin in him, and frequent Converſe with him make us very quick ſighted; and when a Fault does but ſhew it's Head, our Capacity of being angry is preſently kindled; which Paſſion of Anger, we need not doubt was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us by Nature to ſerve ſome good End. Farther, That Volubility of Tongue which is ev'ry Man's Talent when the Thoughts of others are the Theme of our Diſcourſe,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51886:53"/>broaches our Breaſts all on a ſudden, when they are ſtung with Grief for our Friend. Anger and Grief are very neceſſary Tools for the rough Work of <hi>Reproof,</hi> which to ſet about is ſo ungrateful to us (where obſerve, that I do not mean 'tis ungrateful to rail, which proceeds from ill Will, but Reproof implies a Benevolence for him whom we tell of his Faults, and therefore is an unpleaſant Imployment) ſo ungrateful, I ſay, that had it not been for theſe Springs, Nature muſt have been charg'd with our Neglect of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</hi> But all the foremention'd Inſtincts of Nature are ſuch fit Inſtruments of <hi>Reproof</hi> that the Blood of our Friend, if we neglect to reprove, muſt be requir'd at our own Hands, and we need not doubt but they were given us chiefly to make us execute this Irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Task of <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> more chearfully. What better uſe can we put them to? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the great Creator did not deſign them to make us Treacherous to one another, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome about Straws, greedy to ſpill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Blood, or prone to Defame and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite our Neighbours, but the more ready to diſcover our Wounds betimes, that they may be prob'd, and that we may cloſe them for one another.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, ſince Friendſhip is a natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, all thoſe relative Acts and Exerciſes which the entire Diſcharge of it neceſſarily
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51886:54"/>requires at our Hands, are Natural and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Duties: And farther, ſince Friends are the conſtant Objects of mutual Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and are ſo richly capacitated to do one another ſuch a very good turn, ſuch a complicated Act of Kindneſs, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Traytors to one another, if they turn their other Policies and Courteſies into Snares and Briars, by neglecting this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Office of judicious Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly <hi>Iſocrates, Seneca, Marcus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus, Cicero, Ariſtides,</hi> and other <hi>Heathen M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51886:56"/>kindly from Friends, who deal thus with us, becauſe they have a true Affection for us. But I know not how it comes about, but it is too true, that Truth is very offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in this Caſe, 'Tis the Parent of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry troubleſome Damp upon our Spirits: Which Readineſs to take Reproof ill is that which poiſons our Friendſhip.

'Tis the greateſt Fault that a Friend can be guilty of, to ſlight ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Truth, and by an unlawful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequiouſneſs be thruſt into the Snares of Deceit. Wherefore in ev'ry Undertaking of this Nature we ſhould diligently take Care that our Admonition be free from all Bitterneſs, and our Reproof be apply'd without any ſign of Diſeſteem.

And indeed nothing is more abſurd than to ſee Men when they are reprov'd, perfectly miſtake both the proper Object and the proper Cauſe of Trouble and Offence: For inſtead of their being pleas'd with their being reprov'd, and troubled for thoſe Offences, which occaſion'd their Reproof, they take it ill that they are reprov'd, and are not at all vex'd with themſelves for having offended, that they'd tempt one to think they made it their buſineſs to thwart Nature's Commands.</q> There's a great deal more to this purpoſe in his golden <hi>Eſſay about Friendſhip,</hi> which it would be too tedious to tranſcribe. You ſee here that this Author thought <hi>Reproof</hi> the Duty of a Friend, and gives ſome Directions about ſome regular Managements of Reproof, which we ſhall ſpeak of hereafter, and I hope that that Circumſtance in the preſent Citations of this Chapter, being but accidental, will not

                  <p>CHriſtians, if they'l conſult the Sacred Scriptures, may be preſently aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> is a reveal'd and Chriſtian Duty.

                  <p>Revelation beſtows great Eulogies on a Faithful Friend, and particularly on this Act of Friendſhip, and taxes thoſe who either omit to give it, or abuſe it, when given, with very odious Tempers of Mind: Thus <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: A man that has Friends muſt ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf friendly, and there is a friend that ſticks cloſer than a brother;</hi> And here I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear mentioning ſomething of the Son of <hi>Sirach'</hi>s, to this purpoſe, <hi>A faithful friend is a ſtrong defence, and he that has found ſuch an one has found a Treaſure.

Wherefore <hi>Solomon,</hi> in diſſwading us from ſuch an Humour, exhorts us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, by recommending ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fitneſs of Temper and Demeanour for the more fruitful and beneficial Exerciſe of Friendly Reproof. Again, <hi>Open</hi> [ſincere, plain] for he does not mean Publick) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke is better than ſecret love,</hi> that is, than a conceal'd, ſtifl'd or uneaſie Sorrow for a Friend's Miſcarriages. Thus alſo, <hi>A ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hears not rebuke. Whoſo hates Reproof is brutiſh. Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kiſſes of an Enemy are deceitful.

                     <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> are ſo far from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the Dictates of ſound Reaſon, and the Commands of the Moral Law, that they deſign, and accordingly have quite fill'd up the Blanks of both. <hi>Love,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> Their Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Tables of <hi>Moſes</hi> have both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the ſignificancy, and given a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit and perfect Account of the Contents of them. We have in their Writings a full and fixt, a clear and eſtabliſh'd Rule of Life to walk by. The very <hi>poſitive</hi> Duties of our Religion, ſuch as our <hi>Sacraments</hi> and other Ordinances, are not liable to the Alteration of any ſucceeding <hi>O Economy,</hi> for the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian O Economy</hi> is the laſt. We have a longer Liſt of Moral Duties, ſo that the Objects of Reproof are more numerous and obvious to all Capacities in the Goſpel-Age. Which Circumſtance makes Chriſtians more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the want of Reprehenſion, and in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to know what are the proper Subjects of Reprehenſion, without tedious Diſputes, which opportunity thoſe wanted who liv'd
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51886:60"/>in former Times, without the Horizon of the Goſpel. Moreover, the ſurpaſſing Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities we enjoy of clearly making a Diſtinction between <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Truth, Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> together with the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> which we live under (which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodates us with the Uſe of the moſt and richeſt Conduits of Grace and Aſſiſtance from above to guard our Spirits from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting conſpicuous and heinous Guilt, and to exalt them always nearer and nearer unto God) as alſo the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Law-giver</hi> (who is no leſs a Perſon than the <hi>Son,</hi> the expreſs <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Antitype</hi> of all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi>) aggravate all our viſible <hi>Commiſſions</hi> and <hi>Omiſſions</hi> to a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and tow'ring heighth of Preſumption. Farther, Thoſe Agonies which wrung Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of Blood from <hi>Jeſus,</hi> together with his effuſion of his Life upon the Croſs, to reconcile ſinful Men to God, do exhibit the Turpitude of all Sin, in ſuch a lively, pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſtoniſhing manner, that the Folly, Horror and Sting of ev'ry degree of Sin is magnified exceedingly by it's being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſince his Crucifixion.</p>
                  <p>But ſince ev'ry Sin is more dangerous and dreadful, in the Iſſue, to a Chriſtian, it muſt needs be confeſs'd that 'tis a greater Piece of Beneficence to reſcue a Chriſtian from the Clutches of a ſinful Habit and an impenitent
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51886:60"/>Poſture of Mind, after his Commiſſion of any ſingle Act of Sin, becauſe by ſuch Endeavour we ſtrive to deliver him from a more terrible Conflagration of Conſcience and Condemnation at the laſt. For the greater the Light of any Tranſgreſſor is, the greater his Guilt is, and great Guilt is a conſtant incendiary of Condemnation. And ſince <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> ſpurs Offenders on to the Exerciſing that Juſtice and wholeſome Revenge upon themſelves in this State for paſt Offences, which works in them that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (which will ward off the Eternal Condemnation of the Supreme Judge) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dread and avoidance of Sin for the future, Reprehenſion is to a Chriſtian an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Exertion of Love, a very generous and beneficial Exploit. And ſince <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if they conſider, cannot but know this, the Omiſſion of Reproof is more Criminal in them than in a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Heathen:</hi> Eſpecially if they conſider how highly all ſorts of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence are encouraged, and with what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Motives and vigorous Exhortations they are recommended to the Welcome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of all our Powers, by our Sovereign Maſter Chriſt. Beneficence is the richeſt Hecatomb a Chriſtian can devote to God. We do not now as in the ſtate of <hi>Polytheiſm,</hi> ſerve many Gods, Uſurpers, divided and appropriate tutelar <hi>Demons.</hi> Such ſort of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51886:61"/>Divine Worſhip inclin'd the Thoughts of the Worſhippers to patronize Cruelty, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and the ſordid Incloſure of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. But we ſerve <hi>one</hi> God, whoſe Creation of all Men and unconfin'd Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty over, and Providence for all Men, manifeſts him to be the <hi>true</hi> God, and the <hi>univerſal Friend</hi> of all Men: This Notion of the Unity of God, and of his being the common Father of us all (ſince to copy God wherein he is copyable, by our ſeveral Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, is the higheſt Perfection any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be copyable of) repreſents to us how excellent it is to have a Catholick Love for all Men: A ſerious Contemplation on him naturally inſtils this Catholick Love into us: We are the Diſciples of the <hi>Jeſus,</hi> not of a few haughty moroſe and ſtiff Jews, but the Jeſus of <hi>all Nations</hi> and <hi>Ages.</hi> Unity, Loving and lawful Complyance, Sollicitude for one another's Good, Univerſal Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Charity are the Characteriſticks of Chriſtians: We are to wiſh well therefore to the Bodies, Souls and Spirits of all Men: Which does not, as ſome may be apt to think, in the leaſt exclude the lawfulneſs of cheriſhing a ſingular concern for the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Family of Faith. Neither does it force us to overlook particular Love and Friendſhip. We may wiſh well to all, but we can be helpful but to a few: Our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51886:61"/>are inclos'd tho' our Affections are not. And by being very active and immediate Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors to ſome, we declare that 'tis the Faintneſs of our Powers, not of our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which keeps us from being ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to every Individual of the whole rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Globe: For whilſt ev'ry Individual is particularly oblig'd and benefitted by ſome few Individuals, all the Individuals are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd: And whilſt all the Integral Parts are kept in juſt Place and Order, the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of which they are the Conſtituents, ſtands firm and does well. Whence we may learn that eminent Acts of Charity to ſome particular Perſons are conſiſtent with univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Benevolence, and do really and centrally (as has been before obſerv'd) ſatisfie the Aim of a Publick and extenſive Spirit: And therefore, that the Chriſtian Religion's noble Intention to infuſe into the Hearts of all it's Profeſſors a cordial Love and diffuſive Good Will to all Men, does not diſparage and condemn private Friendſhip, but rather obliges us the more ardently to love thoſe who are not only our Lovers, becauſe they are the Lovers of all Men, but are <hi>emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> ſo: How can we conceive that that Inſtitution which enjoyns us to love our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as Men ſhould forbid us to love our Friends peculiarly as Friends? 'Tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51886:62"/>for the ſame Religion to encourage the fouleſt Ingratitude, and the moſt ſignal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore ſince Chriſtianity directs our Kindneſs in an extraordinary manner to ſome particular Perſons, and requires us to do our Friends all the good that it lyes in our Power to do for them, we may be ſure that ſince Reproof is ſuch a great Kindneſs, as has been prov'd (altho' we had had no poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or particular Command to reprove) it obliges us to reprove our Friends for their Faults. Sin and the terrible Conſequences of it are plainly diſcover'd to Chriſtians, and therefore it muſt grieve Chriſtians the more to ſee it in their Friends. That pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Gentleneſs, Judgment and other Graces which they are capable of obtaining by a wiſe and conſciencious Improvement of the Means of Grace, fits them for the due Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Reproof. The Neceſſity and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Reproof has been ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated already, and may farther appear from the Scriptures, which repreſent <hi>Thrones</hi> and <hi>Principalities, Powers</hi> and <hi>Dominions</hi> in Spiritual High Places, inceſſantly conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the Souls of Men. Nothing, therefore can be more convenient for Men than conſpiring to ſave one another's Souls. By Reproof and other pious Acts they may
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51886:62"/>pull one another out of the Fire: By mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Admonition they may keep one another many time from falling into Sin, and by mutual Reproof from obſtinate Perſiſtance in it.</p>
                  <p>At length we may ſee how graciouſly God has made that our Duty which is our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. What we are commanded by him to do, would, if we would but take the Pains to mind the Drift of his Commands, be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſpatch'd by us, not only from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Filial Obedience to his Heavenly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, but, withal, as ſo many Inſtances of Loyalty to the genuine and commanding Beauty and Lovelineſs of ev'ry one of his Commands. Surely we may ſay with S. <hi>John, His Commandments are not grievous.</hi> This delightful Remark could not be paſt by without Ingratitude, whilſt we are going to take notice that <hi>Friendly Reproof,</hi> which is of ſo advantagious a Nature, is one Chriſtian Command, as the ſubſequent Texts witneſs, <hi>If a man ſhall treſpaſs,</hi> ſays our ever-bleſſed <hi>Saviour, go and tell him his fault between him and thee alone. Brethren,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians, if a man be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a fault, do ye, who are ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore ſuch an one in the ſpirit of meekneſs. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> ſays S. James, <hi>if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him, let him know that he which converts the ſinner from the error of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51886:63"/>his way ſhall ſave a Soul from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of Sins.</hi> In ſhort, our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> diligently obey'd his own Command: His Example was a Precept of Authority, and with the conſiderate might have ſaved him the Trouble of an <hi>Oral</hi> Command; for Reproof was honour'd with a bountiful Largeſs of his precious Time, <hi>who went about doing good.</hi> 'Tis true we cann't reprove with that Authority with which he, <hi>to whom all power, both in heaven and earth, was given,</hi> did reprove: Neither can we reprove par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons of <hi>Hypocryſie, Vairglory</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> as he did the Scribes and Phariſees 'Tis not for us to pretend to be intimate with the Hearts of Men, as he was.

I.</hi> The Entrancce into the Chapter, explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Term <hi>Spiritual</hi> in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and aſſigning, in general, thoſe ſeveral Branches and Degrees of Spirituality, which 'tis neceſſary for a Friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover to be furniſh'd with.</head>
                  <p>ONE great Hindrance of the chearful and conſtant Miniſtration of Friendly
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51886:64"/>Reproof is, It's being ſo ſeldom Succeſsful, and one great cauſe of it's frequent unſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is the ſo uſually giving it awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, to prevent this troubleſome Infelicity, I think it expedient to ſhew what Virtues are directly requiſite to ſet up an hopeful <hi>Friendly Reprover,</hi> and ſo by the way what Demeanour and Methods are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt to gain and recover a Friend by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I now conſider Friendly Reproof as a Chriſtian Duty, and ſhall inſtruct you in the Management of it as ſuch, and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I chuſe the great S. <hi>Paul</hi> for my Guide, who charges Chriſtian Brethren to reprove, in caſe they are <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> intimating that it ſignifies nothing to attempt to do any good by <hi>Reproof,</hi> unleſs the Reprover be ſo and ſo qualified, and do apply it in ſuch and ſuch a manner. What the Endowments and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications are which equip a Man to reprove his Friend with Succeſs and leaſt Offence, may therefore be eaſily known by examining who are the <hi>Spiritual:</hi> Here then it will be convenient to have Recourſe to the Place in the Bible where this Qualification is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. Turn to the ſixth Chapter to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and the firſt Verſe, <hi>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, do ye who are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual reſtore ſuch an one in the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:51886:64"/>
                  <p>Some Commentators are of Opinion, That the Spiritual, there mention'd, are the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Magiſtrates or Biſhops, becauſe they receive a greater Meaſure of the Holy Spirit than other Chriſtians; and that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is ſolely given to them, to endeavour the Recovery of Excommunicated Perſons. That Reverence which I bear to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſiveneſs of Chriſtian Texts will not ſuffer me to reject the Senſe, with ſome on the one hand, nor to confine theſe Words to it with others on the other Hand: The neighbouring Precepts are general, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to both Clergy and Laity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think theſe Words may be interpreted as a charge to them all, to ſtrive together to do all the Service they could to the Church, by exerciſing all thoſe ſeveral kinds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reproof, which their different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Spirituality,</hi> and their different Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Relations gave them Opportunity to give. <hi>Spiritual</hi> is a large Term, and it becomes Interpreters to give it that full Scope which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſeems to have deſign'd it. The <hi>ſame</hi> Meaſure of the Spirit does not fit a Man to reprove as a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> which will qualifie him ſufficiently to reprove as a Man, a <hi>Friend,</hi> and a <hi>common Chriſtian;</hi> and yet the <hi>common Chriſtian</hi> may be Spiritual as well as the Chriſtian Magiſtrate: 'Tis the ſame Spirit which is communicated to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51886:65"/>but then 'tis communicated in different Degrees. 'Tis not my Buſineſs to enquire what degrees of Spirituality are prerequiſite to authorize a Chriſtian to accept of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy. Neither does it become thoſe Plain and Ordinary Chriſtians for whoſe uſe theſe Courſe Papers were writ, to be itching to know it. Fraternal amicable and <hi>Friendly Reproof</hi> is ev'ry Man's Duty (tho' there be ſome ſavage Wretches who live without any Friendſhip) and therefore 'tis ev'ry Man's Duty to know how to manage it. This is my Subject, in this I am very ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spiritual</hi> then, if we take it in no higher a Senſe than a Chriſtian endu'd with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Meaſure of the Divine Spirit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Friend, denotes a Perſon whoſe Mind is ſo influenc'd by the Spirit as to elicit thoſe Fruits of the Spirit in his Life and Temper, which are mention'd juſt before, Chap. 5. Verſes, 22, 23. <hi>Now the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> ſaith that Great Apoſtle, <hi>are Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suffering, Gentleneſs, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Nine</hi> Ornaments of a Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them all that Virtue which is neceſſary to make a Chriſtian not only a <hi>skilful</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover of his Friend, but alſo a <hi>Succeſsful</hi> one, unleſs the reprov'd be very brutiſh indeed.</p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:51886:65"/>
                  <p>Of theſe therefore I ſhall treat particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in their Order. Indeed ev'ry one of them deſerves a whole diſtinct Diſcourſe; but I ſhall content my ſelf with giving ſuch a tolerable account as will ſuffice to ſhew how eſſential they are to a well-manag'd Chriſtian <hi>Reproof,</hi> and to extract ſome good Rules about the handy Adminiſtration of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</hi>

                  <head>SECT II. <hi>Of</hi> SPIRITUAL LOVE, <hi>the firſt Qualification.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SIncerity, or a kind Intention, is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Performance of any good Office to another, and therefore eſſential to a <hi>Friendly Reproof,</hi> both as it is a Friendly Office and a Chriſtian Duty. Now there can be no true Sincerity where there is not a precedent Plantation of Love in the Heart; and according to the Degree and Firmneſs of the Prepoſſeſſion of this delicate Principle of Action, there our Sincerity is greater or leſs. Anſwerably alſo to the Value and Dignity of the Object of our Love, our Love is more or leſs excellent: Our Love takes its Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from it's Object. Spiritual Love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that Love which Chriſt recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51886:66"/>to his Followers and the Spirit of God, call'd the <hi>Spirit</hi> by way of Eminence, kindles in our Hearts.</p>
                  <p>This Spiritual Love may be divided into <hi>the Love of God,</hi> and <hi>the Love of God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. The firſt Part of Spiritual Love is <hi>the Love of God.</hi> As Love is the firſt Incentive of all voluntary Action; ſo the Love of God is the leading Principle and Impulſe of all Chriſtian Action. Our Love of God muſt fit in the Throne of the Affections, becauſe he is the Fountain of all Lovelineſs. 'Tis but ſitting that this Love of God ſhould be the reigning Principle of Action in rational Creatures, who are capable of knowing that God is, and that he is the perfecteſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Creator of all Things, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Perfection.</p>
                  <p>This Love of God cannot be <hi>immoderate;</hi> for as his Creating all other beings but his uncreated ſelf, ſhews that he was once more perfect than all of them; ſo his continual Preſervation of them and their inceſſant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon him, after their Creation, declares him to continue the ſame Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Being ſtill. <hi>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever ſhall be, world without End.</hi> Our Love of him therefore ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. It ſhould never Fade and Change. But God being uncapable of receiving any
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51886:66"/>Kindneſs from us, becauſe his immenſe and unparall'd Perfections raiſe him above the poſſibility of being an Object of Beneficence; the only way whereby we can expreſs our Love is to obey his known Will. Hereby we may know that we love God, if we keep all his Commandments. He command us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what he knows is convenient for us to do: Our Acts of Obedience therefore are not Acts of Merit, with reſpect to him, but Acts of Decency and Kindneſs to our ſelves: Which Conſervation and Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Beings, by ſo doing, is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily owing to his Wiſdom, who firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to do them. So that Humility, and a low Conception of any Performance of our own, is a neceſſary Ingredient of a true Love of God. Now this part of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Love is a neceſſary Qualification for our Chriſtian Adminiſtration of Friendly Reproof, as 'tis a Chriſtian Duty in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and not at all peculiar to this or any other Particular Duty. Whenever, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we think of Reproving a Friend, we ought, upon this Conſideration, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it as a good univerſal Rule; this ought to be done Principally, becauſe God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it; for the doing or not doing any thing Principally, becauſe God has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the one, and prohibited the other to be done, is the greateſt Expreſſion we can make
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51886:67"/>to God of our Love. This way of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our Love and Eſteem of God is what is meant by that known Phraſe, having an Eye chiefly to the Glory of God. And when we offer Inferior Motives to perſwade Men to do any Duty, we do ſo in Condeſcenſion to the Frailty of a <hi>common Faith,</hi> that by demonſtrating the fitneſs of an Action in ſuch a Method as does not ſurmount the Verge of a ſenſual Apprehenſion, we may, by degrees, train up their Minds to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Conceſſion of this grand <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> in <hi>Chriſt's School; This is fitting to be done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, the author of all beauty, has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be done.</hi> The Entring upon an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with this Reaſon in our Hearts, as the main Ground and Spring of our ſetting about it, is that which conſecrates Actions and makes a Reproof or any other Action a peculiar Object of God's Care: 'Tis this that ſecures his Bleſſing upon it, of which we need not fear failing, unleſs the Action be of ſuch a nature as to require the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſome other voluntary Action under God (for it may happen often in many Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that another voluntary Agent, for whom 'tis neceſſary to do ſomething towards the Completion, I ſpeak of the Methods of God's ordinary Providence, may hinder the perfect Growth of God's favourable Concurrence with ſuch a dedicated Action.) Thus when
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51886:67"/>we reprove with an Eye to God's Glory, God begins to concur with this Reproof, for the ſake of our good Intention, and makes it as fair for Succeſs as, this Action conſider'd as a ſolitary Action in the Reprover, can be: But ſince the Concurrence of a ſecond volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Agent, namely the Reproved, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, under God, and conjoyntly with the Reprover, to give this Action perfect Succeſs by his Reformation; if the Reprov'd is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, God may withold his Concurrence, and ſo the Action not be crown'd with Succeſs: Nevertheleſs, this Action was bleſt with Succeſs, as far as it was the Action of the Reprover, tho' it was not bleſt as it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Reprov'd: God and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover have done their Parts, and 'tis not fitting that they ſhould be charg'd with the Faults of the Reprov'd: So that whatever the Iſſue of a dedicated Action be, among Men, it cann't be unſucceſsful, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as begun to procure and continue us in the Favour of God; and therefore ev'ry Action, begot by a Principle of Love to God, is certainly Matter of Satisfaction and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency to a reflectful Mind. Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration makes the Agent chearful, conſtant and piouſly reſolute to carry on his Attempt, and not to be diſtruſtful of the Goodneſs of it, whether Honour or Diſhonour attend our doing it, whilſt he lives among Men of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51886:68"/>ſo many different Tempers. His knowing the Action to be a good Action in <hi>it's ſelf,</hi> becauſe God has commanded it, and a good Action too <hi>in himſelf,</hi> the Agent, becauſe he did it purely becauſe God commanded it, frees him from the Trouble of making Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Obſervations upon the Event. This is the conſciencious and the happy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. For you hence ſee that he that does any good Action, becauſe it is a <hi>Duty in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> has a common Principle to act by, and cann't miſs of attaining his main End, <hi>viz.</hi> the Favour of God, in reſpect to whoſe Commands he does it: Whereas, on the contrary, he who does an Action (tho' good in it ſelf) ſometimes to nouriſh Pride, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times becauſe 'tis gainful in that Senſe in which the World uſes it, or becauſe this or that Action is the darling Duty of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſo that it is but <hi>caſually</hi> an Act of Obedience to <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>really</hi> an Act of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Homage to <hi>ſelf;</hi> in ſhort, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for one Reaſon, and ſometimes for another (if the Senſe of a God and his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Laws be not extinguiſh'd in his Mind) he ſets about it <hi>anxiouſly,</hi> for he may as well loſe as gain his End; and if his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, or any other Action, tho' good in it ſelf, fails of Succeſs, he has Reaſon, ſtand Caſes how they will, to doubt that it was not ſo much becauſe of the Default of other
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51886:68"/>voluntary Agents, but becauſe God did not vouchſafe to proſper it, for the Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch ſiniſter and pitiful Motives of Action. Be ſure therefore, Chriſtian, when you are about to endite your Friend lovingly, for any Tranſgreſſion, to remember, before you uſe any Human Means, to look up to God, as him who has Commended the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, by commanding it. Entertain an humble Senſe of the inconſiderableneſs of your own Endeavours, and then chearfully truſl the Iſſue with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The ſecond Part of Chriſtian Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Love is <hi>the Love of God's Creatures.</hi> Now our Love of the Creatures may be <hi>immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi> This is manifeſt: for ſince we ought to love God above all things, 'tis certainly unlawful to love the Creatures more than, or as much as, him. Our firſt Rule therefore to be obſerv'd in the Love of the Creatures is, That the Creatures muſt neither have a greater nor an equal Share with God in our Affections. But tho' we muſt beware not to love them immoderately, yet they may all claim ſome Degrees of Love from us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are all the Workmanſhip of God; and if we love the Creatures as they are the Works of God, our Love of the Creatures is an Expreſſion of our Love of God.</p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:51886:69"/>
                  <p>But farther, to make our Love of the Creatures juſt and moderate, theſe four Rules ſhould be obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The whole Univerſe of Creatures is to be belov'd more than any particular Species; for the moſt glorious Species of all is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Univerſe of Species's; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the whole Univerſe of Creatures gives more Glory to God by their harmonious Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and are a greater Demonſtration of the Exiſtence, Power, Wiſdom and Majeſty of God than any, even the moſt glorious ſingle Species of Creatures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the ſeveral Species's of Creatures ought to be lov'd in different Meaſures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different Degrees of their Reſemblance of God; becauſe one Species does not bear ſuch ſignal Characters of the immenſe Perfections of God their Creator, as another does.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Ev'ry particular Species is to be belov'd more than any one ſingle Creature of that Species; becauſe ev'ry individual is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Species; and ev'ry Species is the immediate Workmanſhip of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a Species of Generable or Ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Creatures; but we know very well that all the Individual Creatures of <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Species, ſetting aſide the two firſt <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſts</hi> of each Species, are not the immediate
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51886:69"/>Works of God in ſuch a Supreme Senſe as Angels and thoſe <hi>Protoplaſts</hi> were.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Particular Creatures of the ſame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in caſe they are voluntary Creatures, ought to be lov'd by us, more or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different Improvements of their Nature.</p>
                  <p>They all reſolve themſelves naturally into this Propoſition. Creatures are the Objects of Man's Love in different Degrees, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different Degrees of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Nature of God. Whence, among other Conſequences, we may deduce, Firſt, That we ſhould prefer the Good of our Neighbour's Soul before the good of his Body, becauſe Man's Spirit is of an Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Nature, which is the Supreme Nature we know of under God; but his Body is of a brutal Nature, which is a Nature inferior to his own Nature, if his whole Nature be conſider'd. Secondly, That we ſhould love Man's Soul and Body, in Conjunction, more than either of them apart, for a Human Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or a Human Body, alone, is but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Creature. That a Human Body is ſo, I ſuppoſe I need not prove: But that a Human Spirit is ſuch, perhaps, may ſound ſomewhat harſh: But, iſ it does ſound ſo, I deſire you to conſider, That if the Soul, when it leaves the Body, were a perfect
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51886:70"/>Creature, there could be no Reaſon given, Why after this State no Man is capable of .preparing himſelf for Heaven? of which we are as certain as that the Scriptures are the Word of God. And yet the final Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is at as great a Diſtance from Separate Souls (by Separate Souls I only mean Souls not yet rebodied) as it is from thoſe that are yet alive; for God has appointed one Day, in which he will judge the whole World. This Truth is likewiſe manifeſted by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, That all Souls, immediately before their final Condemnation or Justification, ſhall be rebodied by the Omnipotence of God; and then, and not till then, be either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly Miſerable or perfectly Happy (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or miſerable they will be (tho' ſeparated) but not perfectly ſo.) Thirdly, We hence learn that ev'ry Man ought to have ſome Men the peculiar Objects of his Love and Care: For Men are the chief Objects of Man's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Angels indeed are more lovely than Men; but then they're above the want of Man's Help. Now the Soul, were it to benefit the Human Univerſe, is to benefit ſome few particularly, as has been before ſhewn. Fourthly, Every Man ſhould chuſe for the peculiar Objects of his Love, the beſt Men, or at leaſt thoſe of the beſt Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with whom he can get acquainted; for good Men, who labour to poliſh and perfect
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51886:70"/>their Nature, love God more than bad Men, who deface their Make; for good Men ſtrive to be more like God, and a Deſire of being aſſimilated and united to any Object, ſhews an entire and firm Complacency in that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: But Wicked Men ſo impair their Frame, that they ev'ry Day go farther and farther from God's Preſence, and are nearer and nearer to that horrible Condition, of being diſowned by God. When I ſay, They flie from God's Preſence, I do not ſpeak with reſpect to God's Omnipreſence, for the right Hand of his Power holds them faſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, but my Meaning is, That God is leſs viſible to them here, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mercy nor Juſtice have their perfect Work, and will be eternally inviſible to them in that Glorious Attribute, his Mercy, in the other World.</p>
                  <p>Now, firſt, we may learn that this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Love of the Creatures is a neceſſary Qualification for the Performance of Friendly Reproof, if we conſider the particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Duty, either with reſpect to the Reprover, or with reſpect to Reproof it ſelf, and the Subjects of Friendly Reproof; or with Reſpect to the Reprov'd, who is the Object of Reproof. For firſt, As for the Reprover, it makes a Man do this Duty with chearfulneſs: For his greater Love for Souls than Bodies convinces him that his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51886:71"/>Friend's Peace of Conſcience, which is the Reward of a ſober Life, does bear ſome Glimpſe of the Satisfaction of God himſelf, is a more ſolid, perfect and durable Pleaſure than the tranſient and momentary Pleaſures of Sin, which Conviction makes his Reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Friend not only a good Act, as it is good in it ſelf; but a good Act in the <hi>Agent,</hi> and conſequently makes it a more rational and ſelf-ſatisfying Act of Charity in him, which will make him adminiſter it chearfully and conſtantly; and by his chearfully doing his Duty he procures the Pleaſure of God, for God loveth a cherful Giver. A Man that loves the Creatures ſpiritually, knows that by his Reproof, which is a ſign of a tranſient and wholſome Diſpleaſure, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prevent his Friend's Pertinacy in Sin, which will degrade his Friend's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and force him, out of Love to God, to be eternally diſpleas'd with his Friend: For Devils and damn'd Ghoſts are their own Creatures: They are Eternal Enemies to God, and therefore are no longer reputed the Creatures of God, or to be look'd on by God as ſuch; and therefore 'tis impoſſible to love God eternally, without hating them with a perfect and unalterable Hatred. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, when our Friend is once enclos'd in that horrible Order, by his Impenitence in this State, we muſt either part with ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:51886:71"/>Friend or our God for ever; but our <hi>Reproof</hi> may make him exerciſe that Repentance, to which (notwithſtanding ſome loving Feuds and Uneaſineſſes during the Intervals of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and receiving <hi>Reproof</hi>) we ſhall owe the Eternal and uninterrupted Enjoyment of both him and God too, where he will be as much above the want of <hi>Reproof,</hi> in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as the bright Seraphim or Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims themſelves. Secondly, Spiritual Love is a neceſſary Qualification for a Friendly Reprover, if we conſider the Nature of <hi>Reproof</hi> it ſelf, to make it Perfect and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial; for this Principle will not ſuffer him to paſs by any viſible Faults, as many do, who reprove for ſome Sins, but do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove for others. The Spiritual Love of the Creature does make a Friend not only reprove his Friend for Drunkenneſs, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Prophaneneſs and ſuch groſs Sins, but alſo for thoſe Extravagancies of the Tongue, and other Faults which the World counts ſmall Sins, and not needful to be reprov'd, becauſe they are not ſo deſtructive of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Credit and bodily Health, or lay the Committers of them open to the Laſh of the Law. Men of carnal Minds will reprove one another for Vices of the firſt Nature, and that too with a ſincere Affection; but then this Affection is but Brutal, Partial and Injudicious: 'Tis an Affection only for one
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51886:72"/>another's Bodies and Secular Intereſts, and does not come up to the noble Pitch of true Spiritual Love. Should one of thoſe carnal Well-wiſhers ſee his Confederate, for the Term Friend is too excellent to be us'd of them, commit ſome private Act of Injuſtice or any other Sin which does not ſtrike the Eye of the World, and ſo undermine their Secular Credit or Welfare, he would rather approve of, than reprove his Chrony for ſo doing: For as for the Welfare of the Soul, lie is not at all ſollicitous about that; and when he reproves him for palpable and open Vices, that threaten his Health and Temporal Reputation, he only does it out of Self-Love, becauſe conſtant Companions being always judg'd to be alike, one Friend's Reputation ſuffers with the Reputation of another; or at leaſt he conſiders that a Friend of an ill Name will have the leſs Ability to ſerve him, becauſe his Intereſt is thereby weakned in the World. But one who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves by the Impulſe of the Divine Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Spiritual Love, having a View of the Soul and the Body together, as they conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute one Man, will reprove a Friend with Regard to his whole Manhood, and therefore will reprove him not only for thoſe Sins which maim his Secular Welfare, but for all viſible Sins whatſoever, whether Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Omiſſions, and that becauſe he knows
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51886:72"/>they are Sins, and therefore, without doubt pernicious to the Soul here, and which, if unrepented of, will treaſure up Anguiſh to both Soul and Body in the other World: For he knows that no Actions can be ſo private but God ſees them, tho' the Eyes of the World are regardleſs of them, and that all Sin being contrary to the Nature of God, God muſt needs hate Sin, and will puniſh it hereafter if it be unrepented of. He wiſely conſiders, that let a ſinful World paſs as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable a Sentence as they pleaſe on Men of looſe Lives, whoſe Intereſts do not ſtand in Competition with theirs, nor hinder their Temporal Quiet, that his Friend muſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever one Day anſwer for it before the final Tribunal, as well as Cut-throats and Robbers muſt for their Publick Injuries which moleſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If they are Sins, be they againſt which of Tables they will, the Devil is very well pleas'd; for he knows that if they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of, he can take an occaſion from them to blaſt the Reputation of the Agent before God and Angels, whoſe Eſteem ought moſt to be priz'd. So that we ſee how neceſſary a Qualification for a Friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover a Spiritual Love of the Creatures is: For it has a Regard to both the preſent and the future State, and if our Welfare and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity in the preſent ſtands in Competition with our Proſperity in the future, it ſubmits
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51886:73"/>our preſent Welfare to our future, becauſe the future is Eternal and the preſent may be buta Moment, at leaſt 'tis but a Moment, if compar'd with the future. So alſo if the Pleaſure of the Body ſtands in Competition with that of the Spirit, and conſequentially with that of the whole Man, if we have a Regard to Futurity, it ſubmits that to this, the leſſer to the greater. Whence 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that Spiritual Love is the perfecteſt Love with which we can love our Friend, becauſe it comprehends the whole Duration of our Friend's Exiſtence, and all his Human Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. Thirdly, We may farther learn from the third Corollary (which was drawn from thoſe Rules which we laid down as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be obſerv'd, to regulate our Love of the Creatures and to make it ſpiritual) that a peculiar Love for the Perſon whom we reprove, is eſſential to a Friendly Reproof, and ſo the Spiritual Love of the Creatures is a neceſſary Qualification in a Friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover, with reſpect to the Reprov'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it regulates the Choice of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Object of our Reproof, for (tho it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all Subjects of Reproof) yet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates the Reprover a different way, with reſpect to the Object, for tho' all Offenders, whether more or leſs, are the Objects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, yet ev'ry Offender is not an Objects of Friendly Reproof in ev'ry Man's Eyes.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51886:73"/>To make a Friendly Reproof agreeable with a Spiritual Love of the Creatures, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that he whom we reprove be our Friend. One of the Rules of a Chriſtian's Love of the Creatures is, To love his Fellow Creatures above all other Creatures under Heaven: Now if he wiſhes well to them all, he muſt, as has been ſhewn, love ſome more peculiarly than others. Should ev'ry Man attempt to reprove, or in any other reſpect relieve ev'ry Man, there would, through the impoſſibility of performing it, be nothing but attempting to do good without bringing any attempt to Completion, and ſo there would be no perfect good done. Wherefore the good Chriſtian endeavours to exert his Love, according to that degree of Strength that God has given him: He can very chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully praiſe God, for having made him a Man, and therefore will be far from aſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be above the Capacity of an Angel: He conſiders that it is God's ſole and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Prerogative to <hi>ſhew Mercy over all his Works,</hi> and therefore humbly ſhews his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feign'd and diſcreet Love to all, by being a peculiar, conſtant and extraordinary Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to ſome. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> have taught us, by the Deficiency of our Strength, that private Friendſhips are the ſtrongeſt Pillars of Univerſal Love. He that climbs to take hold of the Godhead, will fail of diſcharging
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51886:74"/>the Duty of Humanity. A wiſe Chriſtian will not, under Pretence to that Spiritual Love, the Nature of which many, who pretend to it, do not ſo much as underſtand, act pragmatically. If he is call'd to be a Temporal Magiſtrate, he will reprove as a Temporal Magiſtrate: If he is call'd to be a Biſhop, he will reprove as a Biſhop: If he has Children or Servants, he will reprove as a Parent or Maſter: If he has Pupils or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents he will reprove as a Tutor or a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron: And if there is extraordinary Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Caſual Reproof, he will chearfully obey the ſudden Call of the Divine Providence, and ſtand up for the Honour of Religion. Otherwiſe he will meddle with no Body's Faults except his own and his dear Friend's, who ſticks cloſer to him than Brother to Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nevertheleſs, if he ſees a Stranger offend, and knows one who is intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſaid Offender, he will mind that Man's Friend of his Truſt. But not to digreſs; Friends are equal, they know how to inſinuate into one another, as far as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Duty, and to pleaſe one another's Humors, when there is occaſion to ſpeak of a Fault. They know what particular Arts of Addreſs and charitable Policy are moſt likely to work beſt upon one another: They can urge, That they arc oblig'd in Fidelity, Gratitude and Love to reprove. Beſides,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51886:74"/>the Remembrance of a Friend's Favours and Helpfulneſs ingratiates his Requeſts, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens his Reproof, and makes the Phyſick leſs loathſom: His Univerſal Aſſiſtance ſuggeſts that the Reproof is given out of a loving Heart, as far as Love is diſcoverable: But any Act, if it be conſtrued an Act of Love, how tart ſoever it be at the firſt to the Taſte, is pleaſant and grateful in the Digeſtion. Once more, a Friend may reprove conſtantly: He can reprove with <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Parrheſie;</hi> he need not do't <hi>obliquely</hi> and <hi>cowardly.</hi> All theſe Circumſtances plainly ſhew how neceſſary 'tis for us to take care that we reprove none but our Friends for our Faults. Indeed a Friend's Reproof is not always welcome: There are a great many Motives that go to the making it ſo, and therefore a Stranger's Reproof can look but for cold Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This I thought fit to inſiſt on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt of thoſe few who can be got to conſider, that Reproof is a Chriſtian Duty, find it ſo hard to be induc'd to remember not to ſtand tampering with the Sores of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: So very much has Friendly Reproof ſuffer'd by thoſe unſeaſonable Expreſſions of good Will, which indiſcreet Reprovers have made. We need not queſtion but ev'ry Man hath ſome Perſon whom he calls his Friend, and if they who pretend to be his Friends, do not ſhew themſelves friendly in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51886:75"/>let them ſee to it, what is that to us? No Man can be ev'ry Man's Friend without Fickleneſs and Inconſtancy: And, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deprav'd Tempers of the generality, Reproof is not a ſit Act to begin with, in order to recommend us to any one's parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Eſteem and Friendſhip: So that it is propereſt, unleſs you meet with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wiſe Profeſſor Chriſtianity, to give a Signet of your peculiar Kindneſs in all other Inſtances firſt, and perhaps Reproof may be grateful in the rear; for if we would cure the infirm, we muſt handle them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. In ſhort, when any one is your Friend, you may reprove him as your Friend: If he is not your Friend, 'tis his Friend's Buſineſs, not yours, to reprove him for his leſſer Faults. Give others fair Liberty to chuſe their Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, ſince they have as much Right to a free Choice as we can have; and if they make an ill Choice, and will not chuſe new ones, after they have made ſuch a Choice, they are rational Creatures as well as we, and have Miniſters to direct them, and their Blood will not be required at our Hands. Nature will ſeldom let any but a Friend's Reproof operate kindly: No Man can do all Men good: Let us therefore do good throughly to thoſe few with whom we have handſome Opportunities of ſtriking a wiſe Friendſhip, and then we need not queſtion but that the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51886:75"/>great Inſpector of the generous Deſires of our Hearts, and the ſhortneſs of our Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will not condemn us for not doing more than we were able to do, and not aſſaying raſh, extempore and effoet Charities, but will pronounce us before Angels and Men in the great Day of Accounts, faithful Stewards of all our Faculties, to God, and God's ſtately Univerſe of Creatures.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Of <hi>SPIRITUAL JOY,</hi> a ſecond Qualification for a Friendly Reprover.</head>
                  <p>THE great Alienation of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Divine, by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> has engendred ſuch diſmal and dark Apprehenſions of Virtue in our Minds, that we are apt to ſuſpect that a Hook lies under ev'ry Reproof, and that thoſe who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſeparate us from our Sins have a Deſign to abandon us to a State of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, to ſtab this groundleſs Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion in the Hearts of any whom we would reprove, <hi>Spiritual JOY</hi> is a neceſſary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrement for a friendly Reprover: He muſt beware of giving way to any Symptoms of Churliſhneſs and Melancholy, ſuch as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51886:76"/>clouded Looks and waſpiſh Anſwers, and endeavour to breath an Air of innocent Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity in the whole Tenor of his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By Joy I don't mean fooliſh and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Laughter; no, I am ſpeaking of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Joy, a Joy that is the Author of ſober and ſerene Smiles, Smiles that agree with a thankful Recital of Pſalms and Hallelujahs in God's Temple: This repreſents the intenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Acts of Devotion as Acts of Pleaſure: This is a Pleaſure which the Carnal are not capable of, and yet thoſe who enjoy Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Pleaſures enjoy the prime of all carnal Pleaſures, for indeed none but a Moderate Uſe of Carnal Pleaſures can properly be ſaid to be Enjoyment. He that moderately uſes them, has the Prime and Youth of ſenſual Pleaſures, without that Languor, Deadneſs, and thoſe Diſeaſes which the immoderately Senſual find in the extreme and decrepit Uſe of them: In ſhort, Smiles, which are the Preſents of a ſedate and gratified Conſcience. 'Tis Conſcience that muſt be pleas'd: For Conſcience only can procure this Joy of God's Spirit for us. This Spiritual Joy then is to be got by conſtant, circumſpect Walking: For Conſcience has an Eye always bent upon us, and therefore we muſt be always very cautious of doing any thing which will grate upon Conſcience. Innocence, delightful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections and Obedience to the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51886:76"/>is the richeſt Sacrifice we can offer to Conſcience. True Univerſal Repentance is the only Holocauſt with which we can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe this great Perſonage, which ſits Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the Majeſty of Heaven in ev'ry Human Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>This Reverence of Conſcience is a great Preſervative againſt Envy, to which the other Senſe of Spiritual Joy is oppoſite, <hi>viz.</hi> Fraternal or Friendly Gratulation. Gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a Duty, which through the Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Flattery, being confounded with it, is very much deſpis'd and rejected in this Age. What Gratulation is, and what an excellent Office of Friendſhip it is, will take up too much Room in this Treatiſe to ſhew it at large, for it cann't be done without diſcuſſing the great Ends the Creator had in imprinting on our Natures the Faculty of Admiration, an Appetite after Glory; wherein the true Uſe and Abuſe of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts; how Gratulation differs from Flattery, and how we may diſtinguiſh theſe two Acts in another. Farther, this cann't be done without ſhewing wherein Pride conſiſts, and what is not Pride, which ſeems very like it; as alſo without explaining the Nature of Vain-glory, and what is not Vain glory, which ſeems at firſt Sight to unthoughtful Men to be ſo. The generality have very ill Notions of theſe Matters, and therefore to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51886:77"/>inſtruct them fully about the due giving and receiving Gratulation, I am convinc'd (tho' againſt my Will) there will be need of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Treatiſe. However, I ſhall ſpeak two or three Words of it, as far as it has Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, I think, with the Duty of Reproof. To return then, whoever leads ſuch a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life as to rejoyce in the Lord, will be ſo far from grudging and fretting, that he will exult, triumph and roar like the adoring Waves in Heaven, through Joy of Heart, when he ſees God and his lovely Features de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated in another virtuous Perſon: He will rejoyce, according to the excellent Counſel of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> with them who ſpiritually rejoyce. Do you therefore, who would reprove accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, learn hence to be ev'ry now and then congratulating your Friend's Virtues. Seize on all Opportunities of acquainting your Friend how the pleaſant Remembrance of ſuch and ſuch a good Action in him, chears and tranſports your Spirits, and confirms and heightens your Satisfaction, in having made Choice of him for your Friend. Frequently tell him, That you think Heaven expects no ſmall Improvement in Piety from you, upon the account of your Intimacy with ſuch a brave Example of Virtue as he is. This is the way to convince him that whenever you chide him you are not egg'd on by a Spirit of Envy, Detraction, Uncharitableneſs, or
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51886:77"/>an Humour that feaſts on other Men's Faults, to cenſure him, but that you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd by a great Love to his Soul, and a Principle of Fidelity to your Pretences to reprove him. He that praiſes always is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous; and he that is always complaining cann't but be very Burthenſome. By own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely and frequently his Inſtances of a Virtuous Conduct, and hanging much upon theſe fragrant Flowers, your Reproofs will not tempt him to be droniſh and deſpair: And by telling him oft of his Miſcarriages, your juſt and prudent Commendations will not puff him up. Your Praiſes-will prove your Reproofs no Reproaches, and your Reproofs will vindicate your Praiſes from being calumniated for Flatteries. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempering Gratulations for good Actions, with Reproof for bad ones, ſhews a true Friendſhip, as <hi>Agapete,</hi> that <hi>pious Deacon,</hi> has very well obſerv'd. He only mentions Speech, but what he ſays may very well be apply'd to Actions. <q rend="margQuotes">Look upon thoſe, ſays that excellent Author, to be your trueſt Friends, who diligently weigh your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes in a juſt Ballance, and expreſs a Fellow-complacency with you in the beſt of them; but are troubled and frown when you ſpeak otherwiſe; for theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſure Token of their unfeigned Freindſhip.</q> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51886:78"/>Farther, your intermixing Gratulations with Reproofs, ſhews that you are not guilty of too forward a Suſpicion. Thus <hi>Cicero,</hi> in the forecited Eſſay upon Friendſhip, when he had juſt given a Charge to Friends to beware of Diſſimulation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends a ſweetneſs and pleaſantneſs of Behaviour to our Friends; <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there can be no Friendſhip but amongſt good Men; for a good Man will obſerve theſe two Rules in Friendſhip; Firſt, not to diſſemble or cloak any thing which offends him; for a fair and ſincere Perſon, who is of a generous and ingenuous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, will rather chuſe to be an open Enemy than a deceitful diſcontented Friend, and ſuch an one who will not ſpeak his Mind freely in caſe of Tranſgreſſion: So alſo, ſecondly, he will defend his Friend's Reputation againſt the Accuſations of others, and ſcorn to be always ſuſpecting that his Friend has violated ſome Law of Reaſon. Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie and Pleaſantneſs in Speech and Demeanour is that which ſeaſons Friendſhip and gives it a grateful Savour.</hi> In complyance then with the Judgments of wiſe Men, do you, when you reprove your Friend for a Fault, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one of your Friend's principal Virtues, and ask him calmly how incongruous that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51886:78"/>Divine Grace, and the Sin for which you reprove him are. Ah! ſay with Fraternal concern, <q rend="margQuotes">Is it not a thouſand Pities your Life is not all of a Piece, and that you have not a whole ſet of Graces anſwerable to that?</q> And that he may believe that your ſo greedily praiſing whatever you ſee laudable in him, does not proceed from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality from him, or is merely us'd as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine and for Stratagem's ſake, endeavour to bring your ſelf to a Habit of inflaming his and your own Emulation, by refining on the Excellencies of all the Heroick Examples which you either know in Perſon, have heard or read of. <hi>Talk not of other Men's Lives,</hi> are the admired Words of an admirable Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if by <hi>Lives,</hi> as the Context informs us, be underſtood their <hi>Faults, Misfortunes</hi> and <hi>Private Concerns.</hi> But were it poſſible for an Author of that excellent Spirit to have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel'd us to have declin'd Speaking of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of others, according to the falſe Gloſſes of Modern Converſation, they would have been the fitteſt Motto to be inſcrib'd on the Gates of Hell that any Diviſion of that City of Horror and Confuſion could have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Deſperate have made themſelves uncapable of Virtue, and therefore the Thoughts of Virtue are dire and odious to them. Virtue indeed is a beautiful and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Object in it ſelf. Nothing leſs than an
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51886:79"/>Heaven, a God, an all-wiſe and powerful, a ſupreme and infinitely gracious Being to be eternally poſſeſs'd, is the Purchaſe of it: This they know, and, O wretch'd Creatures! They know withal, That there is an unpaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Gulph fix'd between it and them: Thus they do believe and tremble. So that a mere Notional Faith is very conſiſtent with a State of Eternal Diſtance from God: As Unbodied Spirits, they clearly ſee wherein true Happineſs conſiſts, and the means that lead to it. 'Tis this joyn'd with a Senſe of Unattainableneſs of it to them, that turns ev'ry Exertion of Joy unto good Spirits into a Thunderbolt againſt themſelves: 'Tis for this Reaſon that ev'ry Virtue in Man whets their Rage, when they ſincerely conſider, That had they follow'd after a firm Virtue when they were here, as well as thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians whoſe Proſperity they envy and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually undermine, that dreadful Condition need not have been their Portion. But with the Inhabitants of the Earth, bleſſed be God, it is not ſo bad: Nevertheleſs, 'tis too rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to conclude from what has been ſaid, That their Souls are very near thoſe black Clims, who feel all manner of Vice, but eſpecially Envy and Uncharitableneſs, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious in their Breaſts that they cannot bear with the mention of a good Example, or thoſe Graces of God in thoſe who are the brighteſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51886:79"/>Lights of a dark Age: They will grant that a Man may be Proud, Self-conceited, Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical, Vainglorious, and make a ſhew of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety before Men; they know ſo much by themſelves, their Experience tells them this is practicable; they have acted a Part before now as well as the demureſt of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and can, upon occaſion, do it again, in the preſence of a pious Prince, Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor or the like. But as for ſuch or ſuch an one's being Devout from a Senſe of an omni-preſent Being, and an inward Complacency through a ſtate of ſincere Righteouſneſs, conſtant Peace and ineffable Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, they queſtion that very much: You may eaſily apply this to other Virtues, and the falſe Names with which they take care to ſully and obſcure them; but ev'ry Failing, eſpecially in one who ſeems to have a little more Zeal than the inconſiderate Herd, is rich and juſt Matter of Cenſure and Invective. Here Tautology and Exaggeration is pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and you may prate and parrot with a Grace: Compariſons themſelves are not odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe by this means the Drone and the Sot is as good as his Neighbours, tho' he does not make ſo much Appearance: But to buffet his Ears with a tedious and impertinent Harangue about this Man's Temperance, another's Induſtry, laſhes his Idleneſs and Debaucheries, and it ſeems in this Age is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51886:80"/>and unmannerly; the Sight of a good Example gauls him ſufficiently, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to dwell upon ſuch Topicks in Company will diſturb Conſcience too much for the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to enjoy his deceitful Mirth. The good Man's Virtue, naturally of it ſelf, upbraids the Sinner with his Tranſgreſſions, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves his Thoughts: He is grievous to him to behold, for his Life is not like other Men's, his Ways are of another Faſhion; and hence it is that tho' the Wicked Man confronts the Sun in his ſcandalous Courſes, and the whole Town is made privy to his Debaucheries, yet when his Infamy is ripe, and he ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf become the Nuſance and Contempt of thoſe that are round about him, the virtuous Neighbour notwithſtanding his conſtant, courteous and peaceable Demeanor, is ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nay, 'tis well if not poſitively arraign'd with an Oath, to be the ſly Informer and a vile pragmatical Perſon: And to render him ſuch, if he ſpeaks the laſt of the Company, tho never ſo innocently of another Perſon's Fault which firſt provok'd to it, or modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addreſſes to them not to be ſo ſevere on the abſent, they will ſqueeze an Offence out of his Words: They have an hundred Gins in their Ears laid for him, and do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but they ſhall catch ſome ſlight occaſion or other, for a monſtrous Report. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, virtuous Reader, 'twill be our ſafeſt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51886:80"/>way to leave them; and ſince they reſiſt the Endeavours of their Friends for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, let us by no means forget them in our Cloſets. I am now ſpeaking to Men of Candor, who delight in praiſing famous Men, and are as eager to admire their Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours as they are to declaim againſt their Defects. You know this is the way to imitate them, and advance daily in Virtue; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel yourſelves as much as you do your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours already, and yet ſtill to be humbler ev'ry Day than other: Viewing and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about excellent Examples curbs a good Chriſtians extravagant Thoughts of himſelf, and yet makes him a fitter Object of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem; hereby he has always very ſenſible Exhortations to Virtue; for Examples not only exhibit Virtue as lovely, but to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and attainable; nay, it will not ſuffer him to be contented with an ordinary Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it, and to be at a ſtand, but always gaſping after nearer Approaches to a perfect Human Repreſentation of his Creator. Speaking of them to generous Souls is an inoffenſive and effectual Reproof of not only oppoſite Practices, but ev'ry degree of Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh Lukewarmneſs, and other Infirmities which are ſo little taken notice of but by ſelf-conſciouſneſs, that we have no expreſs Names for them to reprove them directly: And, I believe, this indirect Reproof, by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51886:81"/>the Rules of Prudence, ſhould always be tryed firſt; that the reproved Perſon may have an occaſion of hereby knowing how far Generoſity has got Ground in his Heart. This will demonſtrate that you delight in Virtue, and that you reprove Sin from a hearty hatred of Sin. Throw a Roſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on ev'ry worthy Man's Coffin: His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits claim Reſpect to his Monument: They may exact ſome Tribute towards the perſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Name, and the embalming his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory from ev'ry pious Mouth.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, if we would accompliſh gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Purpoſes by mourning with them that mourn, 'tis expedient to rejoyce in due Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with them who rejoyce. The firſt is a powerful Antidote againſt Vice, the latter a brisk Spur to Virtue.</p>

                  <p>Spiritual <hi>PEACE</hi> is a neceſſary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, whether we take it, firſt, for the particular Virtue of Peaceableneſs. Or, ſecondly, for a Satisfaction which ariſes from a general Teſtimony of the Reprover's indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51886:81"/>Endeavour to lead an univerſally righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Life. Or, thirdly, If we take Peace for a particular Satisfaction from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover's conſciouſneſs of his own good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and of the juſt Grounds of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</hi> And, firſt, 'tis neceſſary that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover be noted for the Virtue of Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs; for he that is given to Cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and unreaſonable Suſpicions, to be Quarrelſome and Upbraiding on ev'ry occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, expoſes his Reproof to Miſconſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gives Birth to a Jealouſie in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, that he reproves with a fierce Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and gluts a malicious and envious Temper in ſo doing. As therefore you prize the thriving of your juſt and friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, beware of running into falſe and counterfeit Reproof. Take heed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Reproof.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that God alone is the Judge of Hearts. Beware of arraigning any one for Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, like <hi>Job</hi>'s indiſcreet Reprovers, for that's enough to provoke the Patient himſelf, and will betray them at leaſt into ſome inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Juſtifications; for the Imputation of Hypocriſie is always very offenſive, becauſe 'tis not for one Man to arraign another of Hypocriſie; and therefore to ſuch preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Reprovers, <hi>Job</hi>'s Words may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>How forcible are right Words, but what does your Arguing Reprove?</hi> ch. 6. v. 25.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51886:82"/>Their uncouth Reproofs ſeem'd to be the greateſt Affliction of all to him; and indeed 'tis a common Fault for People to be cenſuring others very deeply and ſeverely, when they are in Calamity through their adulterate and confin'd Notions of the Methods of Divine Providence. If they're Perſons more Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect than others, as to their external Carriage, then, if they can obſerve ſome Specks or Failings in them, they are apt to think that all their Devotion and Warineſs of Behaviour was nothing but Hypocriſie, and a Net to get Love and Repute amongſt Men; but theſe ſhould remember, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome particular Offences, they might be ſincere as to the main, and that Afflictions are ſent rather as Signs of Favour than Tokens of Favour by our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In ſhort, not only beware of the more open Violations of Peace, but don't ſo much as vouchſafe your Ear to a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting and ſlanderous Tongue. Strive to Reconcile many Differences, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair broken Credits, and live as peaceably with all Men as 'tis poſſible for you to do in this Abuſive and Opprobrious World; as far as is conſiſtent with your Affection for your Religion, and that <hi>Peace of God</hi> and Conſcience <hi>which paſſes all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> and which the Violence of no <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> can take from you. Follow Peace, I ſay, with all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51886:82"/>Men, with this Limitation: For the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Man's Reproofs muſt be taken in good Part, if any one's are.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, <hi>Peace</hi> is a neceſſary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if by Peace be meant that Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which ariſes from a general Teſtimony within the Reprover, that it is his hearty Endeavour to live <hi>Godlily, Righteouſly</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,</hi> notwithſtanding very numerous Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in him may be ſeen by his Friends in this Mortal State. This Satisfaction is in a great degree the Largeſs of the Spirit of God; and indeed this Teſtimony is neceſſary to make a Friend vigorous and earneſt in giving Reproof, to inſpire a proper Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and to make it awful, that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion may be the keener, and touch the reprehended Perſon to the Quick. The Senſe of that inexpreſſible Comfort with which an inward Teſtimony of a Tenor of Chriſtian Sincerity refreſhes the Reprehender's Mind, will not let him, in all Love, diſmiſs his Friend, before he has ſo far wrought his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom he would have be as happy as himſelf, up into ſuch a reflectful Poſture of Soul, as to give Audience to the Majeſtick Voice of Conſcience, againſt the Sin for which he reproves him: Which is ſuch a terrible Prediction of the intolerable Anguiſh of a wounded Spirit, and an eternally irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Conſcience, that it cann't but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51886:83"/>the offending Brother that <hi>there is no Peace to the Wicked,</hi> while they continue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently ſuch; and that true, ſolid and permanent Peace is only the Harveſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Integrity. I would not have any one think that I am of Opinion, That no Man can reprove to the purpoſe but he who is conſcious of unſinning Obedience. No, alas! for after that rate no Man could be capable of being a Benefactor by Reproof, for <hi>in many things we offend all,</hi> even the beſt of us. Heavenly Perfection is as inconſiſtent with the Life of Man, in this frail State, as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection is with the Converſe of bleſſed Spirits above. Whilſt the Devil ſlides along the Earth he will be flinging ſome Duſt into the Eyes of the vigilanteſt Chriſtian. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Imperfections nor Sins, if the Offender ſhew his ſincere Repentance by a Tenor of good Life, render a Man unfit to reprove his Friend. On the contrary, this common Senſe of the lability of Mankind, proves the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Mutual Reproof among Friends, and is a fit Motive for every Friend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Friend, that when he offends, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he may merit his Neighbour's Reproof, and the Benefit of ſuch wholſom Awe upon his Soul. But however it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, that there is a great Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Blemiſhes and tranſient Apoſtaſieſ, which ſhew the beſt Chriſtian here to be a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51886:83"/>Man and a Mortal, and that wretched Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and habitual Irregularity of Life, which proclaims many who have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, and do throng our Churches, to be mere, and conſequently hypocritical, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Chriſtian Religion. We ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally charge thoſe who live ſtricteſt, tho' they ſin the leaſt, with Hypocriſie, for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at all; and it muſt be confeſs'd that ev'ry Sin is more or leſs an Act of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, or at leaſt appears ſuch to the Eyes of the World, from which Hearts are lock'd up: But then, certainly thoſe lewd and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Livers, whoſe whole Lives are, as it were, but one continu'd Chain of Sin, have the moſt reaſon to count themſelves Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, ſince by ſinning moſt they give others the ſtrongeſt Temptations to brand them for Hypocrites; ſo that the prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who tramples upon the Promiſe he made at Baptiſm, in the Highways and Turnings of the Streets, till he renounces his Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Vow, muſt be confeſs'd to be the moſt monſtrous Hypocrite, tho' he is the moſt ready to call others ſo, who (tho' they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally may be ſo inwardly) ought to be cleareſt of the Imputation, in our Judgments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſeldomneſs of their Offences gives us leſs occaſion to miſtruſt that they are ſuch. They that offend ſeldom, do not like noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sinners, come with prodigious Beams
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51886:84"/>in their own Eyes, to ſpy and pluck out the Motes of others. Alas! who will ever (tho' upon other Motives he may) deſiſt from a Sin which is of an inferior Nature to ev'ry one of that vaſt multitude of Sins which are inveterate in ſuch a Reprehender, for the ſake of his Reproof? The Serenity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of a vigilant Perſon's Mannerſ (tho' they be not perfect and unblameable in the Sight of the ſpotleſs omniſcient Being, and when they're compar'd with the exact Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of the Divine Law, yet ſince they are perfect, conſider'd as the Manners of a Human Creature, in the ſtate of Trial and Probation, where many Spiritual Enemies and Temptations are to be encountred with) will make way and raiſe Veneration for his Reproof. But that extraordinary Shame and vexatious Contradiction of Conſcience and Countenance, which tormentingly haunts profligate Livers, will not permit them (ſuppoſing they ſhould have ſo much Senſe as to pity Sin in their Friends, becauſe they have the Opportunity of ſeeing the Uglineſs and Turpitude of Sin with more Advantage in others than in themſelves) I ſay, ſuppoſing this, unleſs they have got ſuch a Maſtery over Shame, as to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepar'd Candidates of Devilſhip, it will not ſuffer them to reprove with that Freedom, Courage and Authority, which is the Grace
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51886:84"/>of <hi>Reproof.</hi> A good Man's Infirmities may allow him ſome time to do others good; but ſcandalous Livers are too wretchedly in the Mire, and labour under too heavy a Load of Sin themſelves, to have Heart, Time or Strength enough to relieve others. Whence you ſee how an erroneous Life deprives us of the poſſibility of doing any good thiſ Way. 'Tiſ impoſſible for thoſe who are remiſs in other Duties, to diſcharge this. Such a cloſe Friendſhip of Society do all the Duties of our lovely Religion hold together: So ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary is univerſal Righteouſneſs. He that does one Duty and neglects others, in vain Hopes to do any Duty perfectly, and ſo as to have it conſtru'd Duty by God Almighty. I therefore adviſe ſuch not to unhallow this excellent Branch of Charity with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Mouths, till they have cleans'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Filthineſs, till they are as pure in the Eyes of the candid as they would ſeem to be in their own Eyes, tho' their Conſciences teſtifie againſt them at the ſame time, when they deſecrate, ridicule and backbite this admirable Duty of <hi>Reproof,</hi> under a Pretence of Reproving by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth Exprobrations.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, thirdly, <hi>Peace</hi> is a neceſſary Qualiſication in a <hi>Friendly Reprover,</hi> if we underſtand by Peace a particular Satisfaction proceeding from a Conſciouſneſs of a good
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51886:85"/>Intention, peculiarly when we reprove: For 'tis; a particular kind Intention for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom we reprove, which peculiarizes this <hi>Reproof;</hi> for unleſs you reprove as a Friend, your Reproof is not friendly, tho' he whom you reprove has approv'd himſelf a Friend to you: For, as we have ſhewn in the <hi>ſecond Section concerning the Spiritual Love of the Creatures,</hi> that in order to conſtitute a Reproof friendly in his Eyes, whom you reprove, 'tis neceſſary that you ſhould firſt have receiv'd ſome viſible Token of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from him; and moreover that you ſhould have alſo given him ſome viſible Signet of your Friendſhip; ſo alſo 'tis neceſſary to <hi>conſtitute</hi> your Reproof friendly in the Sight of God, that you be incited to reprove him by a peculiar Love for him, which is viſible only to God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To have that entire Peace which is requiſite to make you a thorough Friendly Reprover, you muſt not fail to have a firm Aſſurance that you reprove him for a juſt Cauſe and upon juſt Grounds, ſuch as your ſeeing him commit a Fault, and that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a Fault which you reprove, a commiſſion or omiſſion of ſomething that is forbid or enjoyn'd either <hi>explicitly</hi> or <hi>implicitly</hi> in the Holy Scriptures. Adhering to this Rule is the Top-Branch of Chriſtian Prudence in adminiſtring Reproof. S. <hi>Paul</hi> has told
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51886:85"/>us, That <hi>all Scriptures, inſpir'd by God,</hi> was given us, among other excellent Uſes, for <hi>Reproof.</hi> 'Tis by them that we infallibly know, without the Pains of long natural Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, what are the fix'd and certain Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Reproof and Commendation; and it is an indiſcreet, I might ſay an impious, thing, to draw Matter of Reproof out of our own Humors: For, what is this but to dictate a new Bible, and to ſuppoſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpir'd Writings imperfect? Ev'ry one is guilty of detracting from the Bible, who offers to make Actions Subjects of Reproof, which the Divine Oracles have not declar'd to be ſo. A wiſe Chriſtian, who looks on the Chriſtian Canon of Reproof to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, need not fear making foul Blunders, or incurring the Cenſure of captiouſneſs and impertinence, which are the two unlucky Apes of Reproof, except it be from ſome Men, who can <hi>charge God fooliſhly,</hi> as tho' he would call Good Evil and Evil Good. It may therefore be convenient to mention the Text which forbids the Act which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or enjoyns the Duty which he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to deſire him to declare his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about it, before you apply your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, that ſo his Conſcience may ſpeak before you, and your treading ſo ſurely may make your Reproof take the deeper Root in his Mind.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:51886:86"/>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, there are ſome inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Singularities which are offenſive in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and do diſcredit them in whom they are obſerv'd; tho' the Geſtures or Actions conſider'd ſimply in themſelves, are not Evil in their own Nature, nor forbidden by God, but are accidentally evil, becauſe they are offenſive, as deviations from Cuſtom in indifferent Matters, for which indeed Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is a Law: And therefore a Friend may very commendably ſtrive to break his Friend of them, becauſe by this means Peace is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted and Offences are prevented. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, it behoves a Friend not to expreſs Indignation, when he ſpeaks of them, ſince they are not Vices, or ſimply unlawful in their own Nature: And in ſuch an Attempt he ſhould chiefly urge, that we ſhould keep Harmony with all Men, by complying with their Humors as far as we can without Sin, and diſpleaſing God, always dreading to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Heart, and raſhly imputing it to Affectation. Charity will ſooner reckon it an Habit and an Infelicity contracted in Youth; and which for that Reaſon muſt be got rid of by degrees. But be ſure you do not dehort him from it gravely, and with as much Solemnity as if it were declar'd Matter of Reproof by God; for we ſhould always take Care to put a Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Actions that are <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:51886:86"/>Evil, and thoſe that are but <hi>contingently</hi> ſo; for if we ſhould ſpeak of offenſive Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities with that trembling and concern as we ſhould when we reprove for a Fault, we ſhould ſeem to be as ſollicitous to deſtroy a Habit, which is only diſpleaſing to Men, as we are to deſtroy a Habit, which ought to diſpleaſe Men, and does certainly diſpleaſe God; which is to repreſent our ſelves, as having an equal Fear of God and Man, that is to ſay, as dreading <hi>Infirmity</hi> and <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> alike. Beſides, ſuch a manner of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about indifferent Habits would make our Reproofs for neceſſary Evils the leſs regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauſe this would make our Reproofs too frequent and trivial; by which means they will bear a hue of daſtardly Fretfulneſs inſtead of the majeſtick Characters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. In ſhort, we ſhould take Care to admoniſh them againſt affecting them, for if they are affected they are wilful Violations of Peace, and ſo they are Sins: But however, affected Offences are not the Object of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reproof, becauſe the Root of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in the Heart, but the Springs of the Heart are inviſible to us. Wherefore, all that we can do is ſolemnly to give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Admonition againſt affecting them. And when we have admoniſh'd them againſt affecting them, the beſt Art we can uſe to break them of them, whether they be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51886:87"/>or not, will be to ſmile them out of ſuch Habits: By ſmiling you'l hint that they are ridiculous Actions and Objects of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to you, as you are a riſible Creature by Nature: And by ſtrugling with your Sides at the Temptation, you will ſuggeſt, that tho' you could not help ſmiling, you would have help'd it if you could, for your not ſuffering your ſelf to laugh will demonſtrate that you are willing preſently to withſtand the Aſſault of any Temptation to ſuch Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which ſavours of Diſreſpect to a Friend; for loud Laughter ſtirs up Rage, and no Man can endure to be made his Fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Baboon.</p>

                     <hi>LOng-Suffering</hi> is requiſite to make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in Reproof, and not weary of well-doing, tho' our Friend is uneaſie under Reproof. Reproof ought to be uneaſie. Both the Reprover and the Reproved ſhould be troubled at their being Occaſion for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. 'Tis this Uneaſineſs that makes pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Perſeverance in Reproving our Friends
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51886:87"/>a Virtue, and the Virtue <hi>Long-Suffering</hi> a neceſſary Qualification whenever we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. Without this we ſhall quickly be diſcourag'd from ever reproving our Friend. We ſhould conſider one another's Infirmities; by bearing one another's Burthens we ſhall fulfil the Law of Chriſt. Man would fain be innocent tho' he is unclean from the Womb, and therefore we muſt allow him to be diſturb'd while his Friend is ſmiting him. After the Potion is ſettl'd, perhaps that which was Gall in the Throat will be acknowledg'd to be Hony in the Stomach: And, grant, the Worſt, tho' he ſhould be ungrateful a long while, yet your patient bearing with his Ingratitude againſt you, will ſhame him into a grateful Senſe of your Long-Suffering Love. 'Tis very unaccountable to leave off Reproving becauſe Reproof is bitter to the Palate. Many Friends have ſown good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations in one another, which, for all their gliding Diſpleaſures, have ſhew'd their Heads above Ground at laſt. God is a God of Patience and Seaſon. We ſhould imitate him, and know when to ſow a Reproof; and when we have caſt it prudently into our Friend's Ear, learn to wait with Submiſſion for the Uſury of our Grain in due time. If the great God condeſcends to call and invite, after many gracious Invitations have been ſlighted, and many Fatherly Corrections
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51886:88"/>have miſs'd of Succeſs, ſhall we think much to wait and condeſcend not to deſert our Friends, even for repeated Abuſes of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof? Is the Servant above his Lord?</p>
                  <p>Briefly, Reproofs are generally own'd ſubſtantial Acts and Exerciſes of Love upon the Death-Bed. Which conſideration, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſhould be a powerful Motive to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in this Duty.</p>

Wherefore be ſure always to remember never to give Whiſperers an Advantage of ſpoiling your Reproofs, or of Soiling them, by being able to tell him, when you ſo much as ſpoke diſreſpectfully of him, or made a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of this or that perſonal Offence.

We cannot either jeer, or ſlander, or backbite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſame Perſon, at leaſt till we have repented of our Miſdemeanours behind the Curtain.</p>
                  <p>Take Care farther, Friendly Reprover, not to let your Freedom with your Friend in private be blur'd by a downiſh Carriage to him in Publick. Whoever contracts friendly Intercourſe with you, honour him at all times according to his Character and Dignity all one as tho he were a Stranger; and tho' ſome may think this Formality, yet I'm ſure 'tis ſuch a Formality as Reaſon preſcribes, for 'tis a fooliſh thing to adopt thoſe for our Friends whom we don't really eſteem, and very abſurd (nay I cann't conceive it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to forbear expreſſing Honour outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe whom we inwardly revere, ſince we are naturally willing that our Friends ſhould believe and know we have a ſincere Reſpect for them. But, indeed, I don't wonder that thoſe partial Friends who are only Partners in Vice, and employ their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51886:89"/>Tongues againſt the Abſent, ſhould condemn outward Expreſſions of Reſpect among Friends, ſince they have at beſt but a brutal Love for one another, and are uncapable of exchanging a rational Eſteem. 'Tis Flattery in them, and therefore deſervedly odious, ſince they're conſcious they don't deſerve it from one another. But I am giving Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to true Friends, who are the Tutors and Patrons of each other's Souls, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of thoſe Subjects which belong to them, and ſcorn to turn Society into an Hell, and Salamander-like to delight to live in the Fire of Strife and Contention. If they talk of others 'tis to contrive to do 'em ſome good, and to make one another uſeful Servants to the Publick. In ſhort, Flattery, Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and toyiſh Complements may be baniſh'd and yet regular Civility may be preſerv'd.

To conclude this Section, Courteſie to our Friend will vindicate our Reproof from the Cenſure of Diſreſpect; and I hope no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be accounted inconſiderable and fit to be rejected, which may gain a free acceſs for your Reproof through your Friend's Ear, to his Heart and Affections, which is that Familiarity which
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51886:89"/>regulates the nobleſt ſort of Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>True Familiarity conſiſts in the prudent exerciſe of a free and generous Intercouſe of Hearts among Friends: When Friends have ſuch a generous Confidence in one another, after a long Experience, and many alternate Tryals of each other's Fidelity and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, as to be able, without Dalliance and Reluctance, to uncloſet their Hearts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occaſion: When they can confeſs their Sins humbly together, without Fear of being threatned to the World for their Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity: When they can mutually enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the peculiar Inſtances of God's graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Providence and Care of them, without the leaſt Dread of being poſted up for Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Pretenders: When they are ſo wiſe and happy as to have no Grief, no Joy which they durſt not communicate: Friends may be truly ſaid to be true Friends and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars. Theſe are the Friends who may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally rejoyce in one another: For ſuch Friends, when the greedy Grave ſnatche; them away, Grace as well as Nature wreſts Tears from us: What Tongue can expreſs that mighty Satisfaction which their being poſſeſs'd of an Intimate who is ſo truſty and diſcreet, muſt need afford? An Intimate, to whom I can venture to reveal all that I know of my ſelf: To whom I can reveal thoſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51886:90"/>Deviations of my Mind, which, for ought I know, none but my God and my Jeſus, my Tutelar Angel and my affectionate Paſtor know beſides my ſelf: Who will beſpeak my Tears for his Failings, and my Thanks for the Mercies which he has receiv'd from the Hands of our common Father in Heaven, who has an Ear always open to the pure and ſincere: An Intimate who will uſe his daily Endeavour to make my Soul more rich and beauteous: Who will inſtil into me a Spirit of Thankfulneſs by his ſeaſonable and decent Gratulations, and ſtrive to make the Incenſe of my grateful Heart more acceptable to the great Patron of Angels and Men, by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and Gratitude to God on my behalf: Whilſt millions of Souls, in all probability are made vain in their Imaginations by the Flatteries of their falſe Friends: Who will contribute towards my obtaining a Spirit of Humility, Penitence and Proſtration of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by his Confeſſion of his own Sins and his Reproofs of mine: A Spirit of Charity, by his fervent Interceſſions: A Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance, by his Admonitions: A Spirit of uncommon Zeal, by his powerful Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: A Spirit of Prudence by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; a comprehenſiveneſs of Underſtanding and a Volubility in the holy Dialect, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating whatever uſeful Maxim he has got by Books, Converſation, Sermons or
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51886:90"/>Experience: This is the Familiarity which enlarges the Underſtanding, rectifies the Will and ſets us forward on our Journey to Happineſs. Is not this therefore the nobleſt Familiarity and moſt becoming wiſe Men? According to this Account of Familiarity, Friends may be familiar without uſing the Language of the Plough, an affected Blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The reaſon why I inſiſt ſo much on this is, becauſe I have obſerv'd 'tis an Art whereby the Devil, tho' few obſerve it, has promoted Unprofitableneſs and idle Jeſting in Converſation. There may be a conſtant Uſe of ſuch Expreſſions as denote Reſpect, without any Danger of Diſtance: This is convenient, that Friends, when they are together, may have that continual Senſe of the Dignity of Human Nature, which is very neceſſary to procure us the true Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Friendſhip: For 'tis this that is the Primary Cauſe of our Capableneſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving mutual Benefit by Reproof.</p>

                     <hi>GOodneſs</hi> or Benignity and Uſefulneſs in all Reſpects, as Opportunity favours, demonſtrates a Man a Friend indeed. Men judge of the Sincerity of their Friends by univerſal, not ſingle Kindneſs, eſpecially if it be a Kindneſs which peculiarly Eyes the Soul. Such is the Frailty, ſo great is the Sottiſhneſs of lapſed Man! O how ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are we immers'd in Senſe! But I will not dwell upon this melancholy Thought. Shew your ſelf an entire Friend to your Friend: Truſt him with great Secrets, even the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of your Soul, as Pledges of your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, and of not taking Notice of his Faults to any Body elſe: Inſtruct him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is ignorant, counſel him wherein he doubts, relieve him in Diſtreſs, readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and faithfully retain his Secrets, have an open Ear to any re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51886:91"/>forgive his particular Breaches of Truſt in your ſelf; have uſeful Conferences fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with him; praiſe his good Actions behind his Back; congratulate any ſort of Proſperity and his Virtues before his Face; exhort him to Perſeverance in the ways of Piety, and in all laudable Deſigns and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; laſtly, admoniſh him againſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences to come. Admonition is a great Act of Charity, and ev'ry Reproof ſhould be back'd with it: It is a Shield againſt all Sins whether external or internal, and aſſiſts all the Faculties of the Soul. Wherefore, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you reprove your Friend for an actual, viſible Fault, don't fail to for warn him againſt it for the future; as alſo againſt thoſe ſecret Maladies of the Soul, bad Suggeſtions and Habits of the Heart, of which the viſible Sin ſeems moſtly to bear a hue; for no human Eye can pierce the Heart, and therefore they are Subjects only of a general and indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Reproof; but, however, they are the Subjects of particular Admonition. The being an Example of ſo many excellent and various Offices of judicious Friendſhip cann't but captivate his Eſteem, and open his Eyes to ſee that your Reproof is a Ray ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Divine Principle of heavenly Love.</p>

                  <p>But ſince Goodneſs is ſo lovely, certainly Gratitude for Goodneſs is comely and ſitting; and therefore I cann't but think it a Piece of Prudence, and very conducive to the Succeſs of the Reproof at the very inſtant of your giving it, to mention to him ſuch or ſuch a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>FAITH</hi> is ſo eſſential to conſtitute any Action Good and Chriſtian, that without it it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. Ev'ry Attempt muſt be dedicated to him in the Name of our Lord Lord <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> whoſe Blood ſhed upon the Croſs was the ſole living Fountain of Pardon and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We muſt remember that 'tis princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for the ſake of this one Mediator that any of our Services are accepted by God. We were put by the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> into ſuch a ſtate of Diſtance from God, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, that had he not ſo lov'd the World as to ſend his Son to be a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, and imparted of his Spirit liberally upon the Apoſtles, after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Aſcenſion, for the ſake of his ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifice and Victory over Death, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51886:93"/>imparted ever ſince more or leſs of the ſame Spirit to all his Followers, none of us could have been in a Capacity of preſenting any Oblation without Preſumption, and without rather exchanging his Anger and Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than procuring his Favour; for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean can offer no Clean Sacrifices 'till they are cleans'd from their Filthineſſes, and the Return of the Spirit of God, without whoſe Aid and Preſence 'tis impoſſible for us to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our ſelves from our original Turpitude. And ſince the Spirit comes upon his account, we muſt remember in ev'ry Undertaking that 'tis principally for his ſake that any of our Services are accepted; and when we have offer'd it to God in the Name and Mediation of ſo great a Perſon as the firſt-begotton Son of God muſt needs be, we ought in Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Merits, notwithſtanding our own unworthineſs to countenance a chearful and ſteady Confidence in God, as to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and Fruitfulneſs of Reproof.</p>
                  <p>If we verily believe that God is, and is a Rewarder of them that ſeek him in the humble Obedience of his Commands, we cann't but reſt ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

God ſees all the hidden Determinations of the Will, and notes down ev'ry loving Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in his Book; ſo that we need not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51886:93"/>ſuſpect that we ſhall fail of a Reward for the diſcharge of our Duty. And then as to our Neighbour, tho' he's peeviſh and apt to be Senſleſs of his Spiritual Intereſt, for Sin is a very dangerous Sorcereſs, and our awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reproofs (for ſuch all, even the beſt Reproofs of ſinful Creatures are, and rather irritate than heal of themſelves) yet Faith fixes our Hope on God, and excites us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to beſpeak God's Grace, to give us Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to reprove in ſuch a Manner as becomes ſuch Creatures as we are, to reprove and to proſper our Friend's Charity to the Health of our Friend's Soul, after we have us'd our beſt Endeavours. This Method, if any, is likely to ſucceed. And here it may not be amiſs to caution you againſt Sacrificing to your own Net, and burning Incence to your own Diag, when your Reproof has took effect. 'Twas by his Breathing on your Project that you ſo happily caught a Soul: Give his Bleſſing therefore the Glory, leſt in juſt Indignation he deny it another Time.</p>
                  <p>And indeed one great Reaſon why general Reproofs have ſometimes pierc'd ſome Men ſo deeply, even when particular ones have fail'd, is to teach us to look up to God who ſuperintends all our Actions and Hearts, as the great Author of all Succeſs; and for that Reaſon always to remember, That his Glory ſhould principally be Ey'd, ſince the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51886:94"/>Converſions of all that repent, as well as the Obſtinacy and Preſumption of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate will terminate into his Glory in that great Day, when the King of Glory with a mighty Power ſhall open the Gates both of Heaven and Hell, and all human Souls, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different Demeanour here, ſhall be admitted into their everlaſting ſtate of conſummate Bliſs or Miſery.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51886:94"/>which daily encourag'd Idleneſs in that Place, that they ſwept him away like a fierce Whirl pool, and plung'd him into a fierce Love with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime of the</hi> Circus. <hi>And tho', at this Time, I was a publick Profeſſor of Rhethorick, he was not then one of my Auditors, upon the account of a private Grudge between me and his Father: Nevertheleſs, I was very much concern'd to ſee ſuch a great Hope in Danger of being ſhipwrack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nay, indeed my Hope was almoſt expir'd, for his Levity and Madneſs at that Time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd Mortal and Incurable: Beſides, I had no fair Seaſon or Pretence to Admoniſh or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him; for I could not reprove him as a Maſter; and as for Friendſhip, I thought that could gain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>SECT. IX.</hi> Of <hi>MEEKNESS,</hi> the eighth Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a Friendly Reprover.</head>
                  <p>THE Virtue <hi>Meekneſs</hi> conſiſts, either in not being ſoon Angry, not being eaſily Provok'd, or Angry without a juſt Provocation, and when we ſhould not be Angry; or, ſecondly, when we are Angry on a juſt occaſion, in bounding that Anger, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls being <hi>Angry without Sin,</hi> for Anger is a Natural Paſſion: Meekneſs is not the Extinction of Anger, but our regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Uſe of it. Now Meekneſs, in both Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is a neceſſary Qualification for a Friendly
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51886:95"/>Reprover: For, firſt, habitual Meekneſs, or ſeldom being angry, and never exerting it without juſt Provocation, is as great in effect as trivial and groundleſs Anger is in Shew. Who can withſtand Meekneſs? When a meek Man, who is not known to be often or haſtily angry, complains, a Friend will conclude that one of the Divine Tables is broken, for it muſt be ſomething that is not only offenſive to his Diſpoſition but is really ill in its own Nature, that can provoke a <hi>Moſes</hi> to exert Anger. A mean occaſion will not raiſe ſuch a one's Paſſion. Bur, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Meekneſs is neceſſary too, becauſe it fits us to bear Reproof patiently and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and it muſt be confeſs'd that ſuch a Temper is neceſſary for a Reprover, that he may be one of an exemplary tameneſs when he is reprovd: For how can he expect that Gratitude from others, which, when he is reprov'd, he will not expreſs himſelf? No one will ever think ſuch an one a ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover. In oppoſition therefore to ſuch groſs Hypocriſie, do you, when you reprove, chide your Friend for not reproving you for a Fault which you have trac'd in your ſelf by Reflection, and for which he did not reprove you, tho he could not but obſerve it in you; that is to ſay, if ever the Caſe ſtands ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Then you may ſay to him thus, or to this purpoſe, <q rend="margQuotes">If Impenitence for this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51886:96"/>Fault would have damn'd me, I ſhould have been never a whit help'd by you to prevent the Cauſe of ſuch eternal Miſery. Is not this very unkind?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as habitual Meekneſs is a neceſſary Qualification for a Friendly Reprover, ſo, ſecondly, actual Meekneſs is a neceſſary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradient of a dextrous Reproof. Actual Meekneſs conſiſts in moderating our Anger. S. <hi>Paul</hi> charges us particularly, to <hi>Reprove in the Spirit of Meekneſs,</hi> and afterwards ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns this excellent Reaſon for it, <hi>conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted;</hi> to which give me leave to add, <hi>and when tempted fall:</hi> For, as 'tis no ſtrange or unuſual thing for us to be tempted in this ſtate; ſo neither is it a ſurprizing Buſineſs for a Man to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Temptations. When we reprove a Friend, therefore, we ſhould take Care to expreſs our Grief and Anger (for Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been ſhew'd to become a Reprover) without Pride and Fiercenſes. It muſt be the Anger of a Friend, not the Anger of a Panther. <hi>Be not high-minded but fear. Let him that ſtands, take heed leſt he fall,</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sentences, and ſhould always be writ upon our Minds, when we are going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, that we may do our Duty without the Commiſſion of a Sin. 'Tis a dreadful Preſumption to tell a Perſon of a Fault only to teaſe and exaſperate him: But I am not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51886:96"/>addreſſing to ſuch Wretches. No, no, there are too many, who, tho' they reprove with a benign intention, fly from a decent hatred of the Sin, and Sorrow, and Trouble for the Offence of their Friend, into an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Anger with the Perſon who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it. Hear me, my beloved Friends, Is this to reprove as Brethren? Rage is no fit Companion for Reproof: This Wrath of Man will not work the Righteouſneſs of God in our Friend: The beſt Reprovers are not ſpotleſs as God. Men ſhould, when they reprove, conſider that they are Men, not Brutes and deſtitute of a thinking Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and that they have to do with Men, not Angels, who are out of the Shot of Temptations. Friends ſhould not, when they reprove, ſpeak like Maſters and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, but like Friends and Equals. Alas! What mean poor Mortals by a magiſterial Carriage in reproving? Surely they forget that we all tread upon ſlippery Places, and wreſtle with Principalities and Powers, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſtumble and are often worſted: That tho' ſome Humble oftner than others, yet all ſtumble often enough to be lowly, and when they 're trip'd up by a Temptation they ſtand in need of a helping Hand. Surely they forget that before Baptiſm they were polluted Lumps of Clay, and have frequently ſince contracted Guilt enough to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51886:97"/>have been thrown long ago into the Kennel of Devils for ever, if infinite Juſtice had dealt rigorouſly with them; and that 'tis by the Grace of Jeſus they are what they are, capable of Heaven by true Repentance, and obnoxious to Hell, notwithſtanding all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without the Application of his Merits. For God's ſake, let us remember, and for Chriſt's ſake, who does not <hi>drag</hi> but <hi>draw</hi> our Souls by his Spirit gently and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionately, that when we reprove a Friend, Sinner ſpeaks to Sinner, leſt Haughtineſs and Wrath anathematize our over-pompous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Sight of God, with whom a meek and quiet Spirit is of great Price. When Friends carry themſelves like Furies to their Friends, the Senſe of the Sin (to quicken which is the peculiar Drift of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reproof) is drown'd in that Amazement and Vexation which boiſterous Paſſion is wont to raiſe: 'Tis to be Precedents of Sin, and perhaps a greater Sin than the preſent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Reproof, even whilſt we bring an Action againſt it. But God will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Meek to reprove ſo awkwardly, for <hi>them that are meek God will guide in Judgment.</hi> A Mind that is not ruffl'd with diſorderly Paſſions will not ſuffer a Man to reprove his Friend, but when his Friend is ſedate and fit to receive it with Profit. The Meek Man reproves with a degree of Anger propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51886:97"/>to the degree of the Nature of the Crime, and not only weighs it's Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but alſo conſiders its Alleviations, and to be ſure he always takes Care never to be hurried into that degree of Anger which does not comport with a due Reſpect for Human Nature, which becomes him as a Fellow-partaker of it; and becauſe in this State the Image of God, which was originally impreſs'd on all Men, cannot be perfectly obliterated. A meek Man never reproves, only to ſluce a private Humor, or unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; but he patiently watches for a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Opportunity to promote a Soul: He hugs and makes much of all Seaſons to do good in: He is not raſh and temerarious; he does not cenſure, envy, repine or fret, nor meddle where his Fingers have no right to feel: He conſtantly uſes his Tongue as an Inſtrument of Good and a Meſſenger of God: He always avoids hurtful Blabbing and Fomenting Strife and Folly by needleſsly multiplying Words: He imitates the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, the Arch-reprover of Mankind, by reproving in a private Place, and in a ſoft Voice, mingling with his Reſentment a powerful and commanding Tenderneſs: His Tears are not as the Tears of the revengeful, Reſemblances of the Sparks of Hell-fire, but they are the overflowing Emanations of a ſilently active Love; and, if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51886:98"/>ſo to ſpeak, effluvia's of the Bowels of the long-ſuffering God, and therefore they cann't but be ſucceſsful Spels for good to the reprov'd, unleſs he has a Heart of Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, a Conſcience all incruſted over with numerous Sins, that have ſettled themſelves into invincible Habits, and a Mind entomb'd in Senſe.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. X.</hi> Of <hi>TEMPERANCE,</hi> the ninth and laſt Qualification in a Friendly Reprover.</head>
                  <p>THAT <hi>Temperance</hi> is a neceſſary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification in a Reprover, is ſo obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that I need not ſpend Time to prove it, ſince no body will liſten to the Reproof of a debauch'd, flagitious and intemperate Fellow. For his Reproof will never be taken for a ſerious Reproof, who is never ſerious him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but when his Drunkenneſs tyes his Tongue, and the Diſeaſes conſequent upon his immoderate Uſe of ſenſual Pleaſures confine him to his Bed. This cann't properly be call'd a voluntary Gravity, and 'tis a very dangerous Error to think that ſuch a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will ſuffice to curry us to Heaven Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I have premis'd that a preconceiv'd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51886:98"/>Belief of the Reprover's good Intention, Friendſhip and Secrecy (for retentiveneſs of Secrets is one peculiar Office of Friendſhip) is one great Recommendation of Reproof. But who is there that cann't more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that a ſottiſh Fellow, who vomits out his Breaſt before Enemies as well as Friends, can be no ſecure Cabinet to lay up Secrets in?</p>
                  <p>I have now ſpoke as much as I thought would be convenient concerning thoſe nine Qualifications which conſtitute a Friendly Reprover, <hi>viz. Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> and have no more to ſay of them than with the great Apoſtle that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd them in this Order, <hi>Againſt ſuch there is no Law.</hi> A Reproof thus mannag'd cann't juſtly be excepted againſt. Such a Reproof is a true <hi>Friendly Reproof,</hi> if any Reproof can deſerve the Name of <hi>Friendly.</hi> Is a Friend qualified with theſe Virtues? He need not fear but he will reprove his Friend with Succeſs and little Offence. And if his kind Aim ſhould meet with a Fruſtration, 'tis the reprov'd Perſon's Fault, not the Reprover's.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe, who tho' they are utterly, or for the moſt part deſtitute of 'em, will be reproving, they had as good lecture to the Winds. Indeed thorough-pac'd Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whoſe extraordinary Prudence and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51886:99"/>Advances in Piety enable 'em to turn Calumnies and Curſes into Bleſſings, may be the better for ſuch ſiniſter Reproofs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers, but they may thank themſelves, not their Reprovers for it. Ordinarily ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Reproof is more or leſs Succeſsful, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as thoſe who offer it do adminiſter it, and are more or leſs ſpiritually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd.</p>
                  <p>After ſo much has been ſaid concerning the Qualifications of a Friendly Reprover, the Reader may admire that I have not ſpoke (except it be occaſionally) concerning Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is generally accounted, as in reality it is, one of the principal Ornaments of a Friendly Reprover: To abate the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Surprize for this Overſight, I deſire him to conſider, 1. That to ſpeak largely of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in general would take up too much compaſs in this little Tract, and, beſides, 'twill be more conveniently done in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diſcourſe about Counſel. And then, 2. That Prudence conſider'd abſtractly, as the Qualification of a Friendly Reprover, 'tis the natural Reſult or Off-ſpring of all thoſe Qualifications which I have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on: They are all of them, as it were, means tending to this End: For firſt, do's not Religious Prudence conſiſt in the Choice of ſome Divine End and Undertaking, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51886:99"/>in proſecuting any Undertaking of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture knowingly, upon good Principles, by wiſe Rules, with Warineſs, Vigour and Conſtancy? Now (to look back a little while) Does not Spiritual Love make the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Renovation of the Divine Image in our Brother, the End of our Reproof, and a Deſire of being in God's Favour, and being more and more aſſimilated to the Source of Charity and Bleſſedneſs, the Principle of our Reproof? Do's not Spiritual Joy clear it from the Ignominy of being taken for Counterfeit and Spurious? Do's not Peace give the Reprover a becoming Majeſty, and propoſe a ſure Canon to walk by, as to the Matter of our Reproof? Do's not Faith make us humble, full of pious Aſſurance and Satisfaction? Does not Meekneſs and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance always preſerve our Minds on their Guard, and ſo make them capable of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſit Stratagems, and of ſufficient Strength to encounter with our Friend's Infirmities? Do not theſe Virtues ſhew the fitteſt Seaſons and Methods of handling a Friend after a late Lapſe? Laſtly, Do not Gentleneſs, Goodneſs and Long-Suffering enable us to be patient and unwearied in this ſort of Well-doing? For who can be ſo fooliſh as to ſuffer all his Kindneſs in other Reſpects, to putrifie and be loſt, only for want of Repeating one Part of the Beneficence? eſpecially with a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51886:100"/>very little Conſideration, he may ſufficiently ſatisfie himſelf that this will mightily enhanſe the Value and Dignity of all his other Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. But, ſecondly, the Conſideration of the Nature of Friendly Reproof has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd us with many uſeful Rules for the dextrous Application of Friendly Reproof; now a dextrous Reprover is a prudent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover, and I do not queſtion that if thoſe Rules (which by way of Conſequence have been interſpers'd in this Chapter be conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly obſerv'd) but the meaneſt Chriſtian may have Prudence enough to reprove his Friend. But the I ſpeak thus, I am very ſenſible that there have been many Rules given beſides theſe; nay, indeed, ſome which run full but againſt them: But 'twas for want of diſtinguiſhing between thoſe Places in which the Scriptures ſpeak of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, or Caſual, or Epiſcopal, or other ſorts of Reproof (which muſt be known by tracing the Connection that the Places uſually cited have with the Context) and others that peculiarly reſpect Friendly Reproof. Wherefore, ſince the careful Uſe of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction will ſerve for a general Anſwer to all that oppoſe me herein, I ſhall not ſwell the Chapter with a particular inſiſtence on ev'ry contrary Direction: For the ſame Reaſon I do not think it neceſſary to beg the World Pardon for not Tranſcribing all thoſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51886:100"/>Texts which Concordances and Syſtems have in conſiderately pil'd together. Thirdly, I deſire it may be conſider'd that theſe are the Qualifications which S. <hi>Paul</hi> has particularly aſſign'd. And I hope we need not doubt but that God will bleſs thoſe Means which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has inſtituted: Can we have a better Guide than the Bleſſed Spirit? Prudence as well as Courage are his Gifts: Thoſe that bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit are under his peculiar Conduct and Tuition, and are the Objects of his extraordinary Bounty (I mean a greater Meaſure of his ordinary Gifts) and therefore have no reaſon to dread a Want of true and real Prudence; for the Nature of true prudence cannot be enquir'd after to any purpoſe among the Crowd, who make ev'ry Senſe a <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and ſwear an implicit Faith to them, but in God's Word and our Cloſets, where the Divine Spirit confers with pure Souls. When all is done, the Race is not to the Swift, 'tis God that muſt make us Succeſsful in the Adminiſtration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof as well as other Affairs; and if we follow the Methods which he has preſcrib'd, we may chearfully reſt on the great Diſpoſer of all Events: He that lives well and loves much is moſt likely to reprove beſt.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Detecting the Vanity of thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Excuſes which have been fram'd for the Omiſſion of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reproof.</head>
               <p>BY this Time I hope we may bring thoſe who neglect this Duty to the Bar, and be able to ſee through thoſe Cobweb-Excuſes that Men uſually bring for their not reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Friends.</p>
               <p>And firſt, Men in vain ask, <hi>Am I my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Keeper? Will not ev'ry Man bear his own Burthen? 'Tis well if I can preſerve my own Soul with all my Care and Diligence: Truly, I find that difficult enough. Experience has clearly verified to me thoſe Words of our bleſſed Lord,</hi> Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life. <hi>There is no need for me to be bound for others:</hi> For does it follow, that becauſe you dare not undertake to fit and dreſs another Man's Soul for Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in another World, you may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully contribute all you can to the fitting of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51886:101"/>him for it? Will the doing another a good turn, when you have a fair Opportunity, increaſe the Difficulty of your Preparation for Heaven? Is not doing your Duty to God and Man one part of that Preparation? How then, ſince Friendly Reproof is both a Natural and Chriſtian Duty, can the Performance of it in due Seaſon be a Hindrance in your Preparation for Heaven? Reproving our Friend agrees with the Golden Rule of <hi>Jeſus, the Law and the Prophets; Whatſoever you would that Men ſhould do unto you, that do unto them, for this is the Will of your Heavenly Father.</hi> Any wiſe Man and knowing Chriſtian muſt acknowledge that he would have his Friend reprove him when he commits a viſible Fault: Why then ſhould he think much to reprove his Friend? Alas! Men fondly imagine, That if they avoid Commiſſions, that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſave 'em; but I muſt plainly tell 'em that groſs Omiſſions are not good Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Heaven, for he that does not what God commands him to do, diſobeys God's Commands as well as he who does what God forbids him. In ſhort, any Man in Miſery would be reliev'd. Charity is Juſtice among Chriſtians, and without it we muſt never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſet one Foot in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>In vain, ſecondly, Men pretend, if they ſhould reprove ev'ry one whom they ſee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51886:102"/>Faults, they ſhould have ſo much Work to do as to have no Time to follow their Calling, for if they mind their Buſineſs cloſely they cann't ſee ſo many Faults in others. All Sins ſhould be unpleaſant to their Eyes. They are ſo far from being enjoyn'd by their Duty to reprove, that they ought to ſcorn, to make a Buſineſs or a Recreation of hunting after Matter of Reproof. Beſides, it has been ſhewn, That Providence expects us very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reprove any but our Friends and Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and I hope that which ſeldom happens will not take up a Man's whole Time. Is your Friend no more to you than any Body? No Man of Principles will think his Friend not worth his troubling his Head about. Since 'tis inconſiſtent with any but the Pragmatical to reprove all Offenders whom we know to be ſuch, we ought to reprove our Friends the more conſtantly. Our Beneficence is confin'd to a few Objects, which few ſhould be our Friends. Reproving then cann't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour much time. There are none ſo hurried with Buſineſs but they will allow themſelves Times of Relaxation. Now, at theſe times we are with our Friends: The being in their Company often refreſhes and whets our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to Buſineſs again: It renews and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorates our Faculties with freſh Vigor and Briskneſs for the Employments of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and when Friends are together how can
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51886:102"/>they lay out their Converſation better than in filing and burniſhing one another's Lives? If our Buſineſs will not permit us to ſecure our everlaſting Salvation, we had as good, nay better, be caſt, with a Milſtone about our Necks, into the Sea, as to mind it: Such Buſineſs is as bad or worſe than Idleneſs.</p>
               <p>In vain, thirdly, Men urge our Saviour's and S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, forbidding us to judge one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againſt giving Reproof; for we muſt not ſuppoſe that God has forbid any thing in thoſe Texts which he hath commanded in others. We ought not to judge Men's Hearts, but we may and ought to judge of the different Natures of Human Actions, for we are not to call Good Evil, nor Evil Good, and thoſe that are viſibly Evil may be judg'd and reprov'd in our Friends, without invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Right. We cann't paſs a final and ſixt Sentence upon the State of any Man's Soul, for he ſtands or falls before the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Sovereign of the World; but we may paſs a Sentence on ſome of his particular Actions, to prevent his Falling before his Lord. This is Charity, whereas the other is Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs, which makes a very wide Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between 'em. Moreover, we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd this Objection ſufficiently, becauſe we have already directed you very largly how to diſtinguiſh Reproof from Cenſoriouſneſs; and one Rule given concerning applying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51886:103"/>was not to reprove for indifferent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but only for thoſe viſible Actions which we can make out to be Faults by any Part of God's Word.</p>
               <p>In vain, fourthly, ſay ſome, 'Tis the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate's Buſineſs to reprove: For tho' the Magiſtrate muſt reprove for the more hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Breaches of the Law, for the Safety of Government; yet it is a Friend's Province to put a Stop to ill Cuſtoms betimes, that his Friend may not by degrees become ſuch a ſcandalous Offender as to deſerve the Reproof of the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>In vain, fifthly, ſome tell us, it goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me to reprove, <hi>I am too good-natur'd to reprove my Friend often, becauſe I cann't but be an Inſtrument of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neaſineſs to him, and a burthenſom Companion by ſo doing:</hi> For 'tis not the cauſing an Uneaſineſs to our Carnal Diſpoſitions, that will mantle our Neglect of a poſitive Duty. Without doubt, if Friends reprove one another for little or no Cauſe, ſuch as innocent Freedoms, Feſtivities and Infirmities that are ſo inſeparable to Human Nature in this State, and therefore cann't properly be call'd wilful, they will unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably reprove too often, and with great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, for 'tis a great Tryal of a Man's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to be perpetually chid for what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid. Avoidable Infirmities only are the Subjects of Reproof. But if a Friend
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51886:103"/>cann't ſafely reprove for ſuch leſſer Freedoms, their Caſe is very pitiable who think they may lawfully cenſure good Men, that are Strangers to 'em, for ſuch Infirmities more than theſe good Men cenſure them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their looſe and licentious Lives. And 'tis worth obſerving, That if Friends reprove for none but real and unavoidable Faults, that 'tis charitably to be hop'd that there will not be ſuch numerous Occaſions of Reproof among Friends, who are ſo conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious as to give and receive Reproof, and if there ſhould be, this uneaſineſs will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh and wear away by degrees, with oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Reproof, through the Delight which its being an Inſtrument of a correct Life will procure: for frequent Reproof is the way to weary a Friend out of his Faults, and ſo Friends prevent, by this means, the trouble of frequently receiving and giving Reproof, and the Sin not only of poſitively, but even ſo much as negatively flattering one another. Whether you reprove your Friend or no, uneaſineſs for his Sins muſt be felt ſome time or other, to keep him from flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ever in Hell. If he will be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he muſt mourn for his Sins, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn thus,</hi> for their Tears make Angels rejoyce, and they ſhall rejoyce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all Eternity. So that by creating or exaggerating this wholſom uneaſineſs you
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51886:104"/>do him a great and unſpeakable Kindneſs: You ſhould not fear your Friend's preſent Diſpleaſure more than his Eternal Ruin. That daſtardly, cereous Temper, which is the Cauſe of Men's not reproving one another, is falſly call'd <hi>good Nature;</hi> 'tis a judicious Kindneſs only that can deſerve that Name. He that is good-natur'd in the firſt Senſe does but conſult his Eaſe and fleſhly Intereſt, has not a regard to Futurity: All that he cares for is to pleaſe and benefit his Friend in thoſe Caſes which are ſufficient to uphold a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Correſpondence and Dearneſs: He has no Divine Senſation nor Principle of Divine Life in him, for if he had he would know, that reproving one another here, however uneaſie it is for the preſent, is a part of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to admit us into the ſtate of eternal Gratulation. In ſhort, 'tis uneaſie to ev ry good Man to reprove his Friend; 'tis his hearty Wiſh, that there were no need of Reproving; but he conſiders, that this is a ſtate of Tryal and Lability, and therefore contentedly ſubmits to God and obeys him, ſince he has enjoyn'd him to reprove, tho it interrupt the Eaſe of his Mind here; and he that will not do his Friend a good Office but when it may be done without the leaſt Trouble, does but very cheap Kindneſſes, and ſo cheapens and undervalues his Friendſhip.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:51886:104"/>
               <p>In vain, ſixthly, you pretend that you do not reprove becauſe your Reproof is not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, and is very much abus'd and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd, for Men's Errors and Wickedneſſes will not ſatisfie for your Neglects. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge your Duty, reprove whom and as you ought to do, and be conſtant in well-doing and your Charity is the greater, and therefore will find the greater Recompence, becauſe it is indefatigable, and you ſuffer for it. Obedience to God's Commands is ſure of a Reward, which ſhould be a ſufficient Motive to the true Diſciples of Chriſt. But we have no Promiſe that ev'ry Reproof ſhall be bleſs'd with Succeſs upon the reprov'd, and therefore our Saviour, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, <hi>If a Man ſhall treſpaſs, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone,</hi> adds, <hi>If he ſhall hear thee thou hast gained thy Brother;</hi> as if he had ſaid, This is a very likely way to gain thy Brother, perhaps thou mayeſt gain thy Brother. The Rule is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly good, but the Succeſs is uncertain.</p>
               <p>In vain, ſeventhly, ſays another, my Friend commits many Faults which I know nothing of; how then ſhall I reprove him for them? How indeed? This is a fooliſh Queſtion certainly, for becauſe you are not bound to reprove for thoſe Faults which you know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of, therefore you will not reprove him for thoſe that you do know of. Good
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51886:105"/>Chriſtian, learn to be aſham'd of ſuch idle Sophiſtry; reprove him for his viſible Faults, and your Duty is done. God does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us, to do what 'tis impoſſible for us to do. Others may perhaps be apt to ſay, as vainly, we have too many Faults of our own to reprove others. I ask thoſe why they don't take care to have fewer. Again, all Men's having Faults proves Friendly Reproof the more ſtrongly to be a Friendly and Social Duty.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, many may complain, That they are not prequalified to reprove with Prudence, and the like. Either theſe Perſons who ſay they are not prequalified, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified, or they are not prequalified. If they are prequalified, they tell a groſs Lie: If they are not, they are not good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: For all the foremention'd Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are as neceſſary to form a good Chriſtian as they are to make a Man a good Reprover. Men's not loving God above all things, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Love of the Creatures, want of Spiritual Joy, Peace, Long-Suffering, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, Goodneſs, Habitual and Actual Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the like, proceeds from a mere formal Profeſſion of Chriſtianity; and ſince all Chriſtians are capable of theſe Virtues, unleſs they deck their Souls with 'em as ſoon as poſſible they can, this Excuſe will not only be rejected as frivolous at the laſt Day, but as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51886:105"/>more inexcuſable than even that Neglect of the Duty for which they apologize with it.</p>
               <p>There are many other Excuſes of the like Nature, which if I ſhould ſtand to anſwer particularly, would diſtend this Chapter to too great a Bulk, and may be eaſily anſwer'd by a cloſe Attention to thoſe Principles which have run through this Diſcourſe, and by which I preſume I have ſufficiently refuted the foremention'd ones: For which Reaſon, I think it would be an unpardonable Abuſe of good Men's Candor and Patience, and a too culpable Compliance with the affected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs of thoſe wicked Chriſtians, who in Truth have no Inclination to promote the good of Souls, to crowd 'em into this little Book.</p>
               <p>Search your Hearts therefore, Chriſtians, penetrate 'em to the Core, and ſee whether or no your true Reaſons are not all, or ſome of theſe, unconcernedneſs to obey the Divine Commands, Dread of the Diſgrace, or Shame of a Repulſe, want of Zeal for God and Virtue, or want of judicious Love for Souls and your Friends, or an Approbation of your Friends Sins, and an unwillingneſs to ſet them an Example, to diſturb your quiet Enjoyment of ſome darling Sins, which you your ſelves actually are (and which is worſe) too likely to be impenitently guilty of till you drop through the Grave into everlaſting Torments.</p>

               <p>HAving detected the Emptineſs of thoſe Excuſes which have been fram'd for the Epidemical Neglect of Friendly Reproof, I proceed now earneſtly to exhort you to throw away all fooliſh Pretences for the future, and to reſolve to reprove your Friends as becomes Chriſtians. Which that you may do, I beſeech you,</p>
               <p n="1">I. Conſider, firſt, you obey one of Chriſt's Commands when you reprove, which will be matter of Peace and Satisfaction to the Conſcience, whatever the Iſſue of it be here. And,</p>
               <p n="2">II. Conſider, ſecondly, by omitting to reprove your Friend you diſobey an expreſs Command, and by not reproving him for ſome Faults, you would have heap'd to your ſelf Treaſures of Wrath, even tho' you had been but an Heathen: Of which ſort are all Trangreſſions againſt the Light of Nature:
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51886:106"/>How horrible muſt this Neglect then be in a Chriſtian?</p>
               <p n="3">III. Conſider, thirdly, what an excellent Duty 'tis: 'Tis an Act of Charity to the Soul, and thereby an Act of Charity incluſively to the whole Man, which is an Eſſence of an Immortal Nature, capable of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Eternal Miſery, an Eſſence for which Jeſus himſelf ſhed his Blood to redeem it from Sin; to deſtroy which, in this Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, is the Aim of Reproof, that it may be deliver'd from that Eternal Miſery and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance into which Sin precipitates all its Slaves. Oh! How muſt it tranſport you to ſee Souls triumphing in Angelical Glory, who, for ought you know had never come thither had not God's Providence done you the Honour to have us'd you as an Inſtrument in his Hand of their Converſion and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication purſuant thereto.</p>

Conſider, fourthly, on the other hand, what Horror the Eternal Damnation of your impenitent Familiars muſt needs excite in you: Familiars, with whom you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many Sins, and whom perhaps you firſt betray'd into a ſinful Courſe of Life, but never reprov d 'em for it or begg'd their Pardon for ſhewing your ſelf ſo much an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to 'em, by deluding them when they took you for a true and real F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iend: Familiars, who, for ought you know, had never plung'd
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51886:107"/>themſelves into that miſerable Condition, if you had but piouſly husbanded the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of your ſuppos'd Friendſhip, which would have introduc'd your Reproof with much Intereſt and Authority into their Breaſts.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Conſider, fifthly, how impoſſible it is to quit the Friend without promoting your Friend's good as much as you can, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently without reproving him ſometimes, ſince the beſt Perſon ſometimes wants Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and none but bad Men, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of true Friendſhip, can want Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſuitable Endowments to reprove. Will you be a Traytor? Will you be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to him who is a Benefactor continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to you?</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Conſider, ſixthly, what a beautiful Act of Charity Chriſtian Friendly Reproof is, if it be well manag'd, and every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may manage it well, by God's Help, if he will. In this Act almoſt all the Human Paſſions are in Agitation, and every one of theſe Paſſions exerted on its proper Object, and kept within its due Bounds: For 'tis compounded of Grief for our Friend's Sin, Anger with the Sinner, kindled by a juſt Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Sin, and that over-aw'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd by a peculiar Love for his Perſon, Joy for the Diſcovery of the Sin, ſince it is befallen him, and there is no poſſibility of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51886:107"/>unſinning any Sin, and we have hereby an Opportunity to heal him, Fear of his Ruin, govern'd by a comfortable Hope that he will recover: In ſhort, the whole Chorus of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Paſſions is made unanimous and virtuous by their ev'ry one of them taking up that ſpace, and being intended on that Object which the Decree of God and Primitive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has mark'd out for 'em.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Conſider, ſeventhly, of what a noble Stock of Virtues 'tis deſcended. A fix'd and exalted Love of God, Complacency in all excellent Examples, Charity to the whole Creation, regulated Paſſions, and unwearied Longanimity, Univerſal Uſefulneſs, a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Condeſcenſion, a canonical Temperance, Meckneſs, Magnanimity, and a conſtant Peaceableneſs of Behaviour, are all, as it were ſo many neceſſary Materials to build this one beautiful Fabrick.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Conſider, eighthly, what a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Train of Bleſſings are the Equipage and Attendance of it; for by giving Friendly Reproof we tye our ſelves the faſter to a conſtancy of regular Demeanour and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Circumſpection for the Sake of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of our Reproof: We engage thoſe whom we reprove, in Gratitude and by way of Debt, to be watchful over us for our good, in the ſame manner. We endear our Souls to God's Bleſſing upon our Spiritual
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51886:108"/>Attempts and Protection againſt all our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemies: We beſpeak a greater Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Grace to adorn and ſtrengthen them with all the Virtues and ordinary Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and admit our ſelves the peculiar Pupils of that excellent Tutor, to guide us in the ſure way to Heaven.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Conſider, ninthly, that we hereby make our Names precious to the publick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of which we are Members, both Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical and Civil, becauſe Friendly Reproof tends to make the reprov'd, make both a quicker and richer Improvement under the Miniſter's Reproof, and prevents him from running into thoſe Crimes which are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Magiſtrate's Reproof, as may be obſerv'd in our Saviour's Directions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our giving Reproof, and the Order and Gradations of it. <hi>If thy brother,</hi> ſays our bleſſed Lord, <hi>ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault, between him and thee alone; if he ſhall hear thee thou haſt gain'd thy brother: But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three Witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſh'd: And if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee at an heathen man or a publican,</hi> Matth. 18.15. So that we may ſe we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by do ſome Service to our Country, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Friend a more uſeful Member of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51886:108"/>the Commonwealth, the holy Catholick and his National Church. The better Chriſtian we make our Friend, the better he will be in all Relations and Conditions of Life.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Conſider, tenthly, we lay up in ſtore for our ſelves many Gratitudes in Heaven, from our Friends; who will then be forc'd with Joy and Exaltation to declare, That a calm and prudent Reproof is the richeſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we can make to a Friend here on Earth.</p>
               <p>Certainly all theſe Bleſſings crowning your Magnanimity and Spiritual Love, will recompence the Luxations of your Friend's Affection here, upon the account of your reproving him for his good, which ought always to be prefer'd before his tranſient Smiles, that may be purchas'd by ſordid Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, which are very cheap and vile Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications: Eſpecially if we conſider,</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Eleventhly, That the ever-bleſſed Spirit of God ſets us an Example ev'ry Day upon our own Minds, an Example of a ſilent but powerful Reproof: He ſets all our Sins in order before us, and reproves us for thoſe which are inviſible to the Eyes of others, ſo that he is in Example of Conſtancy in this Duty to us. Neither need you wonder at this, if you can be prevail'd on to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That there is no room for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof in the other World. All of us there
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51886:109"/>ſhall be either in a State of perfect Bliſs, or a State of Eternal and perfect Miſery. If our Friends are in the number of the Happy above, they will be above the need of the Aſſiſtance of Reproof: If they are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to everlaſting Miſery, no Reproof will do 'em any good, for there is no Redemption out of Hell. Conſider therefore once more, I beſeech you, of what has been ſaid, whilſt Conſideration can be uſeful.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> An inſtructive Addreſs to Reprov'd Perſons, concerning a grateful Improvement of Friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</head>
               <p>HItherto I have been ſpeaking concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing giving Reproof, 'tis high Time now to paſs from the Reprover and viſit the Reprov'd, in order to ſpeak ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the due receiving Reproof. And here every one is apt to ſay, <hi>'Tis better to give than to receive:</hi> Which univerſal Humor of corrupt Mankind makes it ſeaſonable to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51886:109"/>write a Word or two to aſſuage Men's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs when they are reprov'd. An Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs becomes 'em, but this Uneaſineſs muſt be ſteer'd and mitigated by Reaſon: It muſt not be immoderate. If we are reprov'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerv'dly, we ought to make our Defence modeſtly, and ſill thank the Reprover for his Good Will. Now thoſe who don't regulate and bound their Uneaſineſs when they are reprov'd, whether juſtly or unjuſtly, would do well to conſider that immoderate Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs under a well-manag'd Reproof, muſt proceed from either a ſcornful haughty Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or an habitual Brutiſhneſs of Soul. Men would fain have others think that they are wholly free from Pollution and Guilt, and not Sinners like their Neighbours the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans; which unequal Juſtification of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves makes them carry themſelves frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly to thoſe who inſpect their Carriage for their good, and apt to think that they are above the Aſſiſtance of their Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But does not ſuch Pride provoke God, who is jealous of his Honour, and will not bear being vy'd with by any of his ſilly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Unity and Independence are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable Perfections in God. We don't ſtand and fall by our own Sentence: It is not forward and lofty Thoughts of our own Dignity that will bribe or ſcare God into a falſe Judgment and Preference of us before
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51886:110"/>all Mankind. Neither will our ſwoln Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination byaſs and oblige other Men into a Conſpiracy againſt the Truth. They know that we are Men, and Branches of the ſame corrupt Stem with themſelves, ſince they ſee us ſin as well as themſelves. They will not trouble themſelves to ask us whether we are Sinners or not, when we palpably offend under their Eyes. Not only the great God, but even weak infirm Man is not to be mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this caſe. So that proud Rejection of Reproof is as unlikely to procure Reputation with Men as it is to obtain the Favour of God. Conſider, I intreat you, that tho' your Reprover had never told you of your Fault, he would have known it, and might have made it a Subject of Publick Merriment and Deriſion among your Flatterers and Enemies, inſtead of reproving you kindly and privately, that you may repair the Loſs of your Reputation by your future ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In ſhort, by your indecent Pride and Rage you diſcover your ſelf more and more what you moſt induſtriouſly avoid to ſeem. For no Man, doubtleſs is the leſs a Sinner for being obſtinately ſuch. Brutiſh Carriage is but an ill Stratagem to fiſh for Eſteem with.</p>
               <p>But nothing, ſecondly, can be a greater ſign of Brutiſhneſs than ſcornful and untow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſo a Friendly Reprover. For
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51886:110"/>conſider, what foul Ingratitude it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſuch a beautiful Act of Love, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front a true Friend for ſhewing himſelf friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when ſo few now will ſhew themſelves ſuch in this Reſpect. Alas! he could eaſily have enjoy'd your Smiles by a lazy Silence that flatters Senſe; but being a true Friend he cannot, like Flatterers, enjoy himſelf, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh your Smiles with any Delight, whilſt Smiles are not ſeaſonable, and you are in the high Road to Eternal Deſtruction. Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Reproof ſhew themſelves brutiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they don't behave themſelves like Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures capable of Conſideration; for if they did conſider, they would ſhew themſelves Men, that know Sin to be the greateſt Evil, becauſe it is oppoſite to the ſupreme Good, and therefore would know that their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from that is the greateſt Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Theſe are the Thoughts and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which will not ſuffer Men to kick at the Hand that offers to help 'em out of the Gulph of Sin, which leads to Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Conſiderate Men know that it is good for them to be corrected and reprov'd in time, that they may not ſtill go on aſtray, and ſo be condemn'd for ever. They will kiſs the Rod before God in juſtice turn it into a Serpent, and make that which ſhould have melted, an Inſtrument of hardning their Hearts. The greateſt Mercies, if they are
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51886:111"/>abus'd, will prove the greateſt Judgments. A laſting Unſucceſsfulneſs under Friendly Reproofs gives a Friend ſuch a great occaſion of diſſolving his friendſhip, that if your Friend has a true Notion of Chriſtian Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (as doubtleſs one who reproves his Friend with a Chriſtian Spirit has) he muſt think it his Duty to diſcipline you after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reproofs have been, in vain, by profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly cancelling all particular concern for you: Long-Suffering has its proper Limits, and when 'tis trampled on, will provoke him that has it not, to throw Pearls before Swine only to be trod under Foot. Stubbornneſs muſt be cur'd by ſuitable Severity. 'Tis true, a Conſciouſneſs of good Intention props up a Man's Spirit, after his Kindneſs has been very much abus'd: He has done his Part, and may expect his Reward. Nevertheleſs, ſince we are confin'd to no particular Perſon, tho' Friendſhip muſt be exercis'd with ſome, a Man may reaſonably, eſpecially when he has been very patient, ſeek out a Friend who is more worthy of his ſpecial Care and Reſpect. Succeſs in God's Eye is Satisfactory alone; but Succeſs upon the Reprov'd alſo is very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and is neceſſary to heighten our Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, if we can find a Heart that is malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reproof, receives it kindly, and makes the Reproof fructifie in the Reprov'd. One would not willingly be always waſting
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51886:111"/>Seed a barren Soyl, a perverſe Intimate, who when he ſhould obey the firſt Call to Repentance, ſlights Call upon Call, and baffles Reproof after Reproof, till every Fault is grown to that ſtrong Head, that he is as hard to be converted as that Wretch was to be diſpoſſeſs'd, who was beſieg'd with a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Devils. True, our Reproofs clear us from the Imputation of a perverſe Friend's Blood; but to ſee it ſpilt whilſt he is our Friend, creates much Trouble. When a Friend for a long time has refus'd to receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof as he ought, we are exempted from our Obligation to reprove him as a Friend, becauſe by his Unfriendlineſs he has made our Tye to ſuch a near Correſpondence with him, void. Such an one ſhews ſuch Signs of the dereliction of God's Spirit, that all we have to do, till he mends, is to beſpeak with ſtrong Prayers and Agonies ſome awakening Affliction, which is a Divine Reproof, ſince Human Reproof proves ſo weak. But in this laſt we muſt not too haſtily reſcind our Contract: this Sentence, it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, muſt be paſs'd with much ſtrugling, and after Charity has had its perfect Work. Wherefore, as you dread falling into one of the moſt execrable Conditions that you are liable to here, for ſuch your juſtifiably being deſerted by a faithful Friend, is, I deſire you to make the faſteſt Improvement that you
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51886:112"/>can under ev'ry Reproof: Conſider that your Friend is your adopted Father: What your Father was to you in your Youth, he is now: Now a wiſe Son is better for Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It muſt be confeſt that all Sins cann't be conquer'd quickly, but yet they may be conquer'd after more or leſs Tract of Time: And you muſt carefully beware of Mocking your ſelf into a Toleration of Sin in you, and a neglect of fit and requiſite Repentance, by a frequent and formal Uſe of this Pretext. Beware of reſolving to juſtifie your ſelf in an ill Matter; love Truth, tho' ſhe condemn you for the preſent, leſt you be condemn'd eternally. Accuſtom your ſelf to examin the Juſtice of ev'ry Reproof, becauſe that is the way to imprint ev'ry juſt Reproof the deeper in your Mind, and ſo will be a means of making it more conducive to your Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by exhibiting the reaſonableneſs of it the clearer to you; for mild Reception of Reproof without that, tho' 'tis far better than ungrateful turning it from you, will not anſwer the proper End of Reproof, <hi>viz.</hi> the Purification of our Hearts, and the Amendment of our Lives. Another Art of curing this riſe Inclination to Untractable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under Reproof, is the Reprov'd's tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Indictment to a third Perſon: Thus Selfiſhneſs may be remov'd and the Ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the Act will appear the plainer, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51886:112"/>by conſequence the Reaſonableneſs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof will exert it ſelf alſo with the more Advantage. The Truth of this may be evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by what <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Parable, whereby he made way for a ſucceſsful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Reproof. The laſt Method that is proper to be us'd in order to make us grateful when reprov'd, is Prayer to God for a meek and hearing Heart, and the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſome particular Times of giving and receiving Reproof mutually for known Faults, and confeſſing ſecret Faults to one another: For ſolemn Seaſons make the Mind conſiderate, and preſuppoſe a good Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whatever Defect there may be in our natural Temper. Repetition of ſuch Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe will make it habitual and eaſie, as eaſie I mean as Acts of that Nature can and ought to be; for Stupidneſs under Reproof is far from being commendable. It muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd that there is an Uneaſineſs which ſhoots out of a ſharp Senſe of the miſchievous Familiarity of Sin with the Soul, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not laudably be eſcap'd. It becomes us to examine the Juſtice of the Reproof, that by fixing our Thoughts the more intently upon it, if it be juſt, our Compunction may be the ſeverer; and if it be not juſt, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the great Kindneſs it would have done us, ſuppoſing it had been juſt, may be ſo far from rendring us ungrateful,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51886:113"/>as to make us the more thankful to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover; and tho' it became him to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd upon juſter Grounds, yet the leſs nicely the Reprov'd weighs the Qualifications of the Reprover, the more wiſe and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will he be made by ev'ry Reproof Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſee that the foremention'd laudable Uneaſinneſs will not evaporate into ſtubborn Defyance of Brotherly Diſcipline: No, it will rather encline you to comply with the Requeſt I am juſt now going to make.</p>
               <p>When your Friend juſtly reproves you, look on him at that inſtant as the peculiar Meſſenger of God, and under God the Tutor of your dear Soul. Open your Ears, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Heart, and bow your Neck to his Reproof. Freely acknowledge your Fault, and your Obligation to him for forwarding your Repentence, by minding you of it, and beg of him meekly to pray for your Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo great a Mercy. Note it in your Diary, and thank God for the Warning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him to reward your Friend for his Charity.</p>
               <p>This is the way to be truly grateful to God and your Friend, to have a Soul always thriving in Virtue, and making every Day nearer and nearer Advances to Perfection, to have a faithful Friend conſtantly by your Side, and a gracious God always at Hand to bleſs and ſuccour you. This is the way to obtain
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51886:113"/>true Peace, and to inſtill a Reverence of your own Reproofs into others; which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour can never be their Lot who entertain and requite their Friend's Reproofs with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but gloomy Looks and ſhappiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</p>
               <p>Indeed Meekneſs, under truly Chriſtian Reproof, is ſo ſeaſonable and lovely a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that I cannot but adviſe every Chriſtian, as I have briefly already, tho' he be reprov'd unſeaſonably and indecently, not to give way to Fury and Indignation. Patiently bearing with the Infirmities and Indiſcretion of the Reprover, is a lively Draught of the Chriſtian Spirit, and will make every one admire that beholds. Nevertheleſs, when you thank ſuch a Reprover for his good-will, you would do well to adviſe him at the ſame Time to obſerve Seaſon and Moderation in applying his Reproof for the time to come, leſt his Indecencies ſcandalize weak People, to deter them from this excellent Duty. To be brief, Meekneſs, under the ſlanderous Tongue is the nobleſt Triumph and moſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable Vindication of our Innocence, and therefore it cann't but befit a Chriſtian when he is reprov'd by his Friend.</p>
               <p>One more <hi>Memento</hi> may be of great Uſe. Be ſure to take heed of quenching the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Don't ſtruggle with, don't go to foil the Reproofs of Conſcience, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51886:114"/>of Sin, and accuſes us impartially of all Faults. This tremendous Friend is about our Beds, and ſpies out all our Ways. Our Thoughts can find no Shelter from its Eye. Learn to tremble at God's Word, and thoſe Threats which he pronounces by his Miniſters againſt all Sin. Honour his Miniſters for the ſake of their Work and Meſſage. Don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe God in them, for he that deſpiſes the Reproof of God cann't be fruitful under the Reproof of Men. 'Tis our Reſpect to thoſe inward Convictions which God forms in our Minds, when we read his Law, and hear the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, which makes our Souls truly hoſpitable to the loving Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of our Brethren. Be ſure to ſearch your Heart and humble your ſelf in the Day of Affliction, for Afflictions are the Reproofs of God, who charges even his Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Folly, and therefore, without Doubt, there's no Man that is afflicted but has ſome Sin which God deſigns to cure in afflicting him. This, my Friends, is a great Truth, for <hi>how,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, c. 9. v. 2. <hi>ſhould man be juſt with God?</hi> If he contends with him, he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand: He is wiſe in Heart and mighty in Strength. Who has hardned himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and has proſper'd? Who removes Mountains and they know not, who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns them in his Anger, who ſhakes the Earth
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51886:114"/>out of her Place, and the Pillars thereof tremble, who commands the Sun and it riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and ſealeth up the Stars. Dwell upon this Majeſtick Deſcription of God to us, but a very imperfect one, if conſider'd with relation to his incomprehenſible Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and Perfections, that you may revere and make the beſt Advantage of his kind and paternal Reproofs. And then read on again, v. 8. <hi>Who alone ſpreads out the heavens, and treads upon the waves of the ſea; who makes Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades, and the chambers of the ſouth; who does great things paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and wonders without number.

                     </gap> he goes by us, and we ſee him not: He paſſes on alſo and we perceive him not: He takes away, who can hinder him? Who will ſay unto him, What doſt thou? If God will not withdraw his anger, even the proud helpers muſt ſtoop under him:</hi> How much leſs ſhall the humble Chriſtian, who owns God juſt in all his ways, and that Pride was not made for Man; who was at firſt a Clod of Earth, and came a Maſs of Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption into the World, anſwer God and ſtudy a Controverſie with him, whom, tho' we were declar'd Righteous by our own Hearts, and in the Judgment of our Neighbours, yet we ſhould not contradict? For God is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than our Hearts. Supplication better becomes us before our Judge, our All-ſeeing Judge: For he is not a Man, that we ſhould
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51886:115"/>ſet a Time to plead with him. 'Tis vain and impious to juſtifie our ſelves before God. Humble your ſelves therefore all ye that are afflicted, that he may lift up your Souls in due time. I ſhall conclude this Chapter with ſome excellent Paſſages out of the Son of <hi>Sirach. There is a Reproof that is not comely.</hi> Again, <hi>Some man holds his tongue, and he is wiſe. 'Tis much better to Reprove than to be angry ſecretly; and he that confeſſeth his fault ſhall be preſerv'd from hurt. How good is it when thou art reprov'd, to ſhew repentance? He that hates to be reprov'd is in the way of ſinners, but he that fears the Lord will repent from his heart. A ſtubborn heart ſhall fare evil at the last, and he that loves danger ſhall periſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. An obſtinate heart ſhall be laden with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and the wicked man ſhall heap ſin upon ſin. In the puniſhment of the proud there is no remedy, for the plant of wickedneſs has taken root in him.</hi> The Advice is very plain, and need not be inlarg'd on, ſince I hope you will be ſo wiſe as to enlarge on them in your own Hearts.</p>

Firſt, That Fraternal, Private and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Confeſſion of Sins is very beneficial; for ſince Reproving for viſible Sins is of ſuch great Uſe to the Soul, and we are conſcious of many Sins which are inviſible to our Friend, and for which, upon that account, he cannot reprove us; the obliging our ſelves to a Cuſtom of mutually confeſſing all our known Faults will give Friends an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Reproving and being Reprov'd for them too; whereby among other ordinary or extraordinary Helps, we have this Amulet of Reproof againſt all our Sins that are either diſcoverable by our private Reflection or our Friend's Inſpection. But this is not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51886:116"/>a Place to inſiſt at large upon this excellent Duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, We hence learn that we ought to repent of our paſt Neglectfulneſs of thoſe with whom we profeſſed Friendſhip, I mean our not reproving 'em in due Seaſon, as alſo of that peeviſhneſs under Rebuke, by which we have frequently diſcourag'd our Friends from reproving us; for ſince the ſaid Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Reproving, and the ſaid peeviſhneſs when we are Reprov'd, have been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be of a malignant Nature, they ought to be repented of, ſince 'tis our Duty to repent of all our known Sins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, We hence learn to abhor all Flattery, that great Enemy and Oppoſite of Friendly Reproof, which, like the Muſick of the Syrens, forebodes Shipwrack to all their Souls who liſten to it, and are entoxicated with it from others, or deceive and injure others with it themſelves. We hence learn not to truſt the gawdy Promiſes of the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, and to love and prize our Friend's Favour no farther than he acts as is conſiſtent with the Favour of God, who is every Man's chief and beſt Friend, for he is the Friend of the whole Univerſe. The Earth is the Lord's and all that therein is. The Earth is full of the Goodneſs of the Lord.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:51886:116"/>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, We hence learn the dreadful Danger of irreligious Sociableneſs; for ſince not reproving a Friend for a Fault, if it be habitual and unrepented of, is ſuch a great Sin, then certainly to be Confederate with Sinners, to partake directly of other Men's Sins, by tempting them to commit 'em, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronizing them, or the Committers of them, or any other Methods of the like nature, muſt he very dreadful indeed, and ought always to be avoided by you, as you tremble at the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of being thrown into the hotteſt Regions of Hell.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We hence learn, Fifthly, To compute our Friends, to know who are our true and who are our falſe Friends. 'Tis but asking one Queſtion; <hi>Do they uſe to reprove me, or do they not? Do they cocker me in my Sins, or do they ſtrive by Reprehenſion to deliver me from the Dominion of Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixthly, We hence learn, that 'tis our Prudence to ſtrike Friendſhip with thoſe who ſincerely, as far as we are able to judge, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to lead a virtuous Life, and to keep a Conſcience void of Offence, both towards God and towards Man, and to walk in all the Ordinances of Chriſt blameleſs; thoſe, in ſhort, who will conſent that it ſhall be one Article in the Contract, conſtantly and mutually to reprove one another for the Faults which either in the other may diſcern,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51886:117"/>and that this Article may be the better kept, 'twill be prudence to chuſe one who lives near you, and can have a frequent Eye on your Behaviour. Moreover,</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seventhly, becauſe ill Inclinations and Habits are quite oppoſite to one another (for Vice is a medly of Contradiction, whereas all Graces compoſe one beautiful Harmony in the Soul) 'tis adviſeable to chuſe one for your Friend, whoſe darling Corruption is oppoſite to your own, becauſe he has not any Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Sins which moſt eaſily beſet you, which will make him reprove you the more conſtantly: And you too, for the ſame Reaſon, the faithfuller on your part. When two Extremes lovingly encounter, the two Minds, which are apt to ſink into theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, will by degrees be poliſh'd into that golden Mediocricy, which is the Centre of all Virtue. All Men are naturally prone to be carried away without the Grace of God and their own Endeavours, by ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ill Inclination.</p>
               <p>Thus ſome are apt to be too flexible, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of too ſtiff a Diſpoſition; ſome are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver angry and ſome are always ſo; ſome are aſpiring, others dejeſted; ſome are too jealous, others are too careleſs. 'Twould be endleſs to inſtance in all. Now if we obſerve by the Tenor of a Man's Life, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of theſe particular ill Inclinations
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51886:117"/>that he ſtrives to live unblameably, we have no Reaſon to except any Man, when we would chuſe a Friend for the ſake of any ſuch particular ill Inclination. 'Tis an habitual Indulgence of Sin, not an ill original Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which makes any Perſon unfit for Friendſhip; for the having ſome ill original Inclination is inevitable, tho' the being do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer'd over by it is avoidable by the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt. If we defer our Choice of a Friend till we find a perfectly good Friend, we muſt ſtay till we are launch'd into the Ocean of Purity, the Kingdom of Heaven; and 'twill be too bold to promiſe our ſelves, that we ſhould get thither, if we don't accept of the Advantage of but the imperfect Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of good Men in this State to advance us there, where we ſhall be above the need of particular Friendſhip. The beſt Rule that we can obſerve is, to chuſe thoſe for our Friends, whom we obſerve to be the moſt induſtrious in their Preparations for Heaven, tho' we cannot any more than charitably hope that they are in a way to be prepar'd for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 'Tis a great Miſtake to think that ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of natural Temper is a Foundation of Chriſtian Friendſhip. Such Men's Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Complacency in one another's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, I queſtion not, will make their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſuch as it is, laſt long; but the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is whether or no, ſince theſe Tempers
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51886:118"/>are natural, and traduc'd from corrupt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, if we throughly enquire into 'em, they will betray us (if indulg'd too much) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin. If ſo, they muſt be rooted up, if we'll be true Chriſtians, and conſequently that durable Friendſhip rooted up with 'em too, which the Similitude of the Saints na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tempers pitch'd in our Minds. Chuſe the good natur'd for your Friend, and avoid the Angry, is a common Maxim. And who are the good natur'd? Why, in proper Speech, thoſe that are good by Nature, of which ſort, ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> it may be ſafely ſaid, There was never yet one to be found. But good-natur'd, in the Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of the Vulgar, denotes thoſe that are eaſie and compliant, ſo immoderately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant that rather than they will diſpleaſe their Companions, tho' it is very agreeable to the Dictates both of Reaſon and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for us to diſpleaſe and contradict one another, Truth ſhall be betray'd and explod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Black ſhall be voted White, and their Friends, tho' they ſin never ſo heinouſly, ſhall always paſs unreprov'd, Religion ſhall be ridicul'd Scot-free, and what not? Theſe good-natur'd People, with the Religious are Religious, and with the Irreligious can be as contentedly Irreligious. Now whether or no this ſort of good nature (if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to ſhew my ſelf an Example of it, by
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51886:118"/>complying with the Erroneous Multitude in calling it ſo) be not a predominant Paſſion, which muſt be corrected, cultivated and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated by our Endeavours, concurrent with the Spirit of God, who alone can make us Peaceable without being ſinful, and which otherwiſe will be a very ſerviceable Tool in carrying on the Devil's Trade of Undoing Human Souls, let the unprejudic'd judge. <hi>Solomon</hi> indeed ſays, <hi>Make not Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with an angry Man,</hi> but he do's not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe us in thoſe Words to contract Intimacy only with Men of a peculiar, branchy and compliant Nature; for he does not mean by <hi>angry</hi> there, one who is naturally inclin'd to be angry, but one who does not curb, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and regulate a peculiarly vigorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Anger; for if we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the firſt, we muſt ſuppoſe a great part of Mankind excluded from all poſſibility of Friendſhip, ſince a great many are inclin'd to be immoderately, and too ſoon angry, which nevertheleſs may be good Chriſtians, and therefore good Friends: For why may not the Grace of God cure that as well as other Inclinations? Nay, indeed, I need not have ſaid a great Part of Mankind, for according to that Interpretation of the Word <hi>Angry,</hi> in <hi>Solomon,</hi> no Man is fit to be a Friend, ſince ev'ry Man is viſibly inclin'd very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>gly to ſome particular Extreme,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51886:119"/>tho' not to the Extreme of <hi>Anger;</hi> and thus we muſt exclude our good-natur'd People too: For never to reſent, be the Occaſion never ſo juſt, or the Conſequences never ſo momentous, is as bad as to be continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting without Cauſe, out of Place, too long or too ſoon. Is there an Anger which tends to no good? Why, ſo there is a Baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs (if we may believe a very wiſe Man) a Silence, a ſluggiſh, immoderate, irrational Compliance, that has trundled many Souls to Hell, and therefore tends to no good.</p>
               <p>To draw near to a Concluſion: 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to have Friends here, that are good by Nature or perfect by Grace; the beſt do but follow after Perfection here. Your beſt way then will be to deny your ſelf, by chuſing one for your Friend whoſe Capital ill Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (be it that of Anger or Compliance, or any other) is contrary to yours, that is to ſay, provided, beſides the Oppoſiteneſs of his original, involuntary Inclination, he has made a ſteddy Reſolution (which is but the adopted Inclination of the Religious) with your ſelf to ſtrive againſt it, and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt you to ſubdue your ſtrongeſt ill Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For this will ſhew that you are ready to deny Self for the ſake of Virtue, and that you are willing to cut off the exceſſive Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; which is the moſt deform'd Protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of your Soul. Your Endeavour
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51886:119"/>ſhould be the ſame with your Friend's, to conquer all immoderate Inclinations to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes in one another; but it is moſt eligible that the peculiar and ſtrongeſt Inclinations of both of you to ſome certain Extrems ſhould not be the ſame, becauſe your Danger will in all likelihood by this means be ſtrengthn'd inſtead of being leſſen'd. If the flexible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate moſtly with the flexible, they will but make one another more credulous and apt to be deluded: If the Cholerick are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with the Cholerick, they will in all probability inflame one another's Paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Melancholy People are not fit Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for the Melancholy, becauſe they are not fit to carry on the general good Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vanquiſhing all Extremes in one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The Obſervation holds good in other Caſes. Many Men had never been ſo ſottiſh and knaviſh, ſo moroſe or circumducible, if they had had the Prudence not to have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with thoſe moſtly whom they found ſtrongly inclin'd by Nature to the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes. But I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more largely of this in another <hi>Eſſay. Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem velle &amp; nolle firma amicitia eſt,</hi> as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> ſpeaks: And <hi>Amantium irae amoris redintegratio eſt,</hi> to ſpeak with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median,</hi> are very excellent Sentences, and very reconcilable with one another: For 'tis true, that to have the ſame virtuous Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51886:120"/>which cannot contradict one another, is the Foundation of a firm and ſound Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and 'tis as true, that to let our Vices, which are oppoſite to one another, draw Blood from one another, is the way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the Traytors, and to bring you to that Place where your Friendſhip will be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger athletick, but like the Union of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels, will ſuffer no Interruption, and be too ſtrong to be broken by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynt Forces of Hell.</p>

               <p>MY Diſcourſe is now almoſt expir'd, all that is yet remaining is the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Part: And ſince I have done my poor Endeavours, I hope, Chriſtian Reader, I may without Offence humbly mind thee of thy Part. To read Books like Cormorants of Novelty, only out of Curioſity, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable Thirſt after New Notions, is rather
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51886:120"/>to ſtrive to be ſingular, than to be good. When the Mind is made Tid by a multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Books, and our Life, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing improv'd and form'd more regularly, becomes ſuperciliouſly more and more neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; Reading is ſo far from Benefitting, that it does great Miſchief to the Peruſers, for to him that knows God's Will and do's it not, to him it's Sin. I do therefore earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly exhort thee, Not to ſuffer theſe Leaves to increaſe thy Condemnation, by a curſory and fruitleſs reading of them. Think and conſider ſeriouſly of what has been writ, that thou may'ſt not repent in the End that thou haſt beſtow'd ſo much Time, Candor and Patience on this rough Work. Conſider, I beſeech thee, that Opportunity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention are too valuable to be flung away: They are rare and of great Price in ev'ry wiſe Man's-Eye, and therefore 'tis Unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Folly to be prodigal of them. And, if after due Conſideration, thou art convinc'd of the Reaſonableneſs of the Counſels herein given, joyn with thy ſincere Well-wiſher and ſay: <hi>The Lord proſpers the Devices of the Simple, and breaks in Pieces the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </p>
               <p>And I am inclin'd to believe, That if the Drift of this mean Performance be anſwer'd by but a very few Chriſtians, God may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be mov'd to enable thy ſincere Friend to write with that Clearneſs and Vivacity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, which I ingenuouſly own are very much wanting in the preſent Work: Nay, perhaps, if the Reader, tho' not out of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me, yet for the Sake of the Subject, and the Publick, will be ſo wiſe as to connive at the Deformity of it, ſome great Maſter of this Faculty may at length be prevail'd on to take the other Acts of Spiritual Beneficence into their own Hands: For they know the Worth of their own Time and Labour too well to run that Hazard which the mean do. But indeed I have found ſo much Repulſe in this Affair, that I have almoſt condemn'd all ſuch Hopes for Dreams and deceitful Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations. We do not ſee the Nakedneſs, Poverty, Filth and Dangers of our Souls, as we do thoſe of our Bodies: Were the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of patient Thoughts as obvious and as eaſie to be got as thoſe of Senſe, 'twould be otherwiſe; but ſince 'tis not ſo, I don't wonder that ſo many Perſons, whom God has bleſt with excellent Parts, when they have no ſet Seaſons of ſerious Meditation, ſhould flight thoſe Subjects which immediately relate
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51886:121"/>to the Improvement of the Soul, whilſt to pleaſure ſome corrupt Patrons and lewd O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of this Age, for the ſake of a little vain Applauſe and leſs Profit, they have dreſs'd up Vice and Debauchery in all the Gallantry of Wit and Expreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the great Diſadvantage of Religion, and the Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Chriſtian Kingdom: But not to diſtract the Good, or enrage the Bad with any more Reflections of this Nature; <hi>Let,</hi> I earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly intreat thee, <hi>Love be without Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Speak the Truth from the Heart one with another, for we are Members one of another. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor that which is Evil, and cleave to that which is Good: Follow after Charity,</hi> for this is the way to poſſeſs your Souls in Peace. Do good and reprove according to your ſeveral Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities: <hi>Walk worthy of the Vocation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you are call'd, with all Lowlineſs and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with Long-Suffering, forbearing and curing one another's Diſorders. Walk in Love, as Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that ye may be angry and yet not ſin:</hi> That ye may <hi>reprove,</hi> and yet <hi>put away from you all Bitterneſs, Wrath and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, with all Malice; being hind, tender-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, forgiving one another, even as God, for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you:</hi> Learn to be impartial, and to converſe with all Godly Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity in the World: <hi>Walk as Children of Light: The Fruit of the Spirit is Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth:</hi> Wherefore <hi>prove what
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51886:122"/>is acceptable unto the Lord. Let no corrupt Communication proceed from you, but that which is good and edifies, and will miniſter Grace to thoſe that hear.</hi> And that you may, when your Friend ſtrikes you on the one Cheek <hi>[any tender part]</hi> turn the other alſo <hi>[be ready ſtill to be diſciplin'd for ſome other Sin which does moſt eaſily beſet you] ſubmitting to him in the Fear of the Lord.</hi> Be ſure never to grieve the Spirit of God. Christians, <hi>Be not wiſe in your own Conceits:</hi> Be not lofty in your own Eyes. We ſtand here in the midſt of Snares and Enemies, whether we be in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Diſhonour, whether we abound or are in Want: We wreſtle not only with Fleſh and Blood, but with Principalities and Powers, with Spiritual Wickedneſs in High Places, and therefore had need ſtand in a watchful Poſture: The Devil accuſes us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our God Day and Night: Is it not therefore prudent to link together, to ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with one another's Infirmities? To be weak with our Friends when they are weak, to burn when they offend, after the Example of S. <hi>Paul?</hi> Sin is the Adverſity of the Soul, and therefore the ſoreſt Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of all: The Spirit of a Man may ſuſtain his Infirmities, the Soul may be above all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Calamities, but a wounded Spirit who can bear? Nothing can give the Soul any laſting Support, under Guilt. Miſery will cling
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51886:122"/>for ever about the Spirit, unleſs that be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd: Now it cannot be remov'd any where but here: So that 'tis in vain to think of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving a Friend under this Adverſity in the other World, as the Devil, who makes it his Buſineſs to throw us into it, very well knows, when he ſuggeſts Delays to us, if he finds us inclin'd to help one another out of it: Let us therefore ſpeedily unite our Endeavours, and not be ſo baſe as to diſown our Friends in the dark Seaſon of Adverſity: To day it is not too late: To Morrow it may be ſo. Let us countermine him in his own Way, by accuſing our ſelves and one another, that by our Humiliations we may deliver our ſelves from the Power of Sin here, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ways of it, even Eternal Torments in the other World. When we uſe our beſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Endeavours both by our ſelves and with one another, we may reaſonably truſt in God, and in a pious ſuccumbency on his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Grace and Spirit, promiſe our ſelves a Victory, if we continue unto the End. But proudly contemning ſuch a mighty Enemy, and a lazy Relyance on God, who has made us Creatures capable of Vigilance, Activity, Counſel, and aſſiſting one another's Souls, will not avail us now, nor anſwer for us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Final Tribunal.</p>
               <p>This is not a Place of Eaſe and Reſt: We have many Corruptions to ſubdue: There is
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51886:123"/>no Poſſibility of living without ſome Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of our Peace, ſome Thwarts and Rebukes, till we are arriv'd thither, where there will be no ſuch thing as Improvement, but we ſhall always enjoy that degree of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with which we are inverted at our firſt Entrance. But here the beſt Man may excel himſelf and daily find ſome Occaſions of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in his Life. The Senſual only ſeek Reſt in this World, and therefore think much to be in the leaſt diſturb'd in the Enjoyment of their Luſts. They are impatient of any Lett in the Career of Concupiſcence: The Reaſon of this is becauſe they have ſhook off the Reins of Reaſon; but a wiſe Man has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the End. And for that Reaſon, how irkſom ſoever the Method of Frienſhip, which has been now propos'd, may be to the Fleſh, he will readily imbrace it, ſince 'twill prove, after conſiderable continuance in it, Sanata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Spirit, and Perfective of the Man. Religion at firſt walks with its Subjects by crooked Ways, brings Fear and Dread upon them, and torments and ſearches them with her Diſcipline 'till they ſee the Beauty of her Laws, and ſhe can truſt their Souls, refin'd as Gold in the Furnace, without Curb and Reſtraint: Then ſhe raviſhes them with ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Comforts, and that Peace which is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Saints: Before the laſt ſolemn Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, the Tribunal of an honeſt Friend will
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51886:123"/>be an entertaining Image to the Memory. When the outward Man decays, the Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inner Man will be a great and ineſtimable Staff to the Heart: When we are viſited by extreme Sickneſs, the captivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proſpect of our Admiſſion into a Place, where all Society is of a gratulatory Nature, where we ſhall be above the Aids of all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Ordinances; where all Tears ſhall be wip'd from our Eyes; where we ſhall converſe only with God, Chriſt, good Angels and glorified Human Spirits <hi>irrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibly,</hi> and ev'ry Reproof will be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd into Myriads and Myriads of Gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will more than compenſate our Loſs (to ſpeak for once in the Dialect of the Earthly) of the tranſitory ſtinging and allay'd Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Sin.</p>

                  <hi>Now the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſanctifie your Spirits, Souls and Bodies, and ſtrengthen you in every good Work and Word; and pour his Grace plentifully upon you, that you may be fit to Reprove and receive Reproofs from one another in all Lowlineſs and Love; that your Love and Friendſhip may abound more and more in all Judgment; that you may approve all things that are excellent, and be ſincere and without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence till the Day of Chriſt, being filled with the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt, unto the Glory and Praiſe of God, Amen; For his beloved Son's ſake, who dyed for our Sins and roſe again for our Juſtification, and to make us zealous of good Works.</hi>
